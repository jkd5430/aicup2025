19	Any overture of something that's kind of like a little white flag or peace offering to just get a week of peace, I'm not talking about permanent "I'm going to placate and cow tow to you and to talk my needs in other..." No. Just talking about lets...
23	Yeah, I imagine it would — sorry, go ahead. So it's supposed to work immediately, right? Yep. So we'll see if I'm productive tomorrow. I hope I'm productive today. I've actually been trying to plan. If I do the titles today, then I can do my laundry tomorrow. Right. I probably could bring my computer and do titles while I'm doing my laundry. If I was — but I won't do that.
121	It makes it really hard when I lose things. Even this morning, he knocked over my glasses. I had them on the dresser and he was trying to find them this morning because I can't see anything without my glasses. He was like, "Are you sure you didn't put them somewhere else?" and I'm like, "Yes, I put them in one of two places. They are in neither. I heard you knock them over last night when you came back and the lights were off." He got annoyed that I was blaming him and I got annoyed that he got annoyed for me blaming him when it was his fault. He eventually found them obviously because I'm wearing them but that was a stressful way to wake up.
156	My dad makes a big deal of his not being a native English speaker, even though he learned English when he was eight years old and has been speaking it since then and speaks fluently. I think he just uses it as an excuse, but with the written word, you can reread it if you don't understand and there's a wall.
218	Yeah, I am actually, yeah, yeah. Ok, so just so that I’ve got the story straight, this all began about 6 months ago, before that had you had anything like this? No, not at all, I mean, I think we had a new manager at work, I work in a bank actually, and then we had a new computer system put in and so it became very much more stressful for all the staff, not just me, - and I can sort of see I was under a lot more pressure.
1000	Were you ever worried about were you feeling you were getting really addicted or over your head? When we did it before class, I kind of sat back and reevaluated how much I was doing it and whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, and I kind of had this fleeting thought, like maybe I'm getting a little bit carried away, but I think because I couldn't do it every day and
1002	Alright. Keep journaling. If there's a specific distortion at some point. Any one of these that comes up. Something where you get overwhelmed with self-hatred specifically and it escalates. Write about it. Okay? Okay. And then bring it in and talk about it. Do you want Should I? I would love to look it over, yeah. Okay. Thank you.
1074	like my pinkie. We would have Jaime snacks, but I wasn't allowed to eat them.Jaime? Jaime, sorry, his name is Jaime, like James. Oh, James snacks? Yeah, like Jaime snacks. He would have Cool Ranch Doritos. I remember the Doritos and I wasn't allowed to eat the Doritos as much as he was. Because he was thinner?
1089	Right. You’re not going to the pub, you’re not socializing like you used to? No, no And you’re avoiding things like exercise and things like sex, and that’s having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship. It is a bit, yeah. Ok, ok. And, looking at you. I know you’ve had an ECG. Yeah, yeah What have you been told about the results of that?
1092	How do I know that he really wants to be married to me if he doesn't know any like an idea of a type of career? Yeah. Or, does he ever want to go back to school? Does he ever want to, you know, own a house and things like that. Mm. Mm hm.
1093	Alright, thank you. Ok can you stop it.
1101	the things that you feel like nothing is going to come of this anyway? It is. And it's also feeling frustrating to spend like a couple of hours and all I can say is, "I looked through the job boards for this, this and this." Mm. "And there was nothing. And that time is gone and I still don't have a job." Mm. It's just, yeah, it's feeling daunting and exhausting. Yeah.
1103	I have a much easier time finding friends than James does and I don’t know whether that’s because I am – I don’t know – better at finding people or less picky about the people that I want to be friends with or whether it’s because I’m just positioned right in a way that James is not. I don’t know if the types of people who tend to do graduate degrees in chemistry are all that different from the types of people who tend to do graduate degrees in theology.
1159	Yeah, you know, usually there’s like, there’s some books out, and t-shirts, and sort of sci-fi
1209	And what we need to do is keep working until it's different enough. Yeah. That it's more recognizable. Yeah. But yeah, I guess the other question is also like, did I ever do the whole like signing the waiver for you to talk to Dr. Barnes about the medicines? Um hmm? Okay. I thought I did. I was just double - I believe that's in your file. checking. Okay. I assume I signed it on her end too.
1212	But then there are also assumptions in that that sort of needs to be thought about. Yeah, and in this specific case, it wasn't so much like It wasn't so much that I thought she was suicidal in the moment and that anything I said might push her over the edge, but it certainly has that subjects related to my behavior in those time periods. It's more than So part of it is that since she's already made the or is about to make the call to
1225	it's unfortunate he couldn't step out to help you, but..." She felt like it went back to his...he and Ivan are more friends than anything which is...I don't know how I feel about that but I mean he was not at all able to be...it wasn't like an initial hysteria and then he calmed down, like had a plan. No... So he was hysterical on the phone? He wasn't like sobbing and...but he was really emotional and he was very clear that he wanted me to call
1307	You know that always brings me out this question of why are you here? Why do we do this? Like what…? Yeah.
1336	I think without a little, a drink or something to make this go smooth, I’m like, I need some form of social lubrication here, and being around a lot of really drunk people while sober is boring. I can imagine that exacerbating a bunch of things that already bothered you. Yeah. I mean being with them in the elevators was bad enough. I guess part of what I - What I’m wondering about is, in the medication, I mean... I’m, like,
1346	I pull up the index and sure enough, the guy who had the property died with a will, and all I need to confirm is this one person was the sole heir of the will or the person in the will to get the property. But it's in storage, the file is in storage. They're starting to put everything in storage now which fucks me because these are — typically the late 60s and 70s are when I need probates and those older ones, they order on Fridays.
1406	I'm actually especially sensitive to dirt when you have enough stuff on the floor that you can feel it on your feet, especially if you've taken a shower and then your feet are wet and stuff sticks to your feet. It's not a good feeling. It's getting harder and harder to deal with that. So those are the things that are stressing you out, those things that aren't the way you would have them, aren't really under your control because you're not going to take responsibility for cleaning his place.
1444	So that it wouldn't be something that you would need to sort of have on your mind and work toward. I see. It would be a given. Yeah, that's not a given. Yeah. And then the question is-which is I think a big question-but, you know, why not? Yeah, so that's one of those like really deep questions that I have a hard time grabbing.
1461	Did he call Ivan or did Ivan's mom call Ivan? Huh uh. No one called him? No everybody's acting like nothing ever happened and Martin was very clear on the phone, he's like "This conversation never happened, until you hear from Dr. Bourd.
1472	I am, Ok. - yeah, just talking about it. I can feel it starting to come up. Right, take your time. So, your heart starts to race, it really beats really fast and you feel like you can’t catch your breath, is that right? Yeah, that’s exactly it. How long’s all this been going on for? I think it’s probably about six months, basically, yeah. Right, Ok and can you remember what happened to start it all off?
1473	Yeah. I usually end it always. So far. Yeah. Well no, sometimes I’m miserable and don’t go. Yes, that’s true, but as long as you’re around - Yeah. You know, I don’t like it.
1482	Well, you have two months. I have two months. That's true. I've taken June off and I think that was a good call; but maybe I'll be regretting that decision the end of August. Perhaps between now and then, thinking about what it is that really needs to get done and setting reasonable goals in a timely way it doesn't make sense to pack up everything now. There may be things you need, but thinking about what needs to get done and what can get done.
1527	That was around lunchtime on Friday and I forgot about calling them. I was in the middle of dying wool. My purse was upstairs and my hands were covered with dye so I didn't have the numbers. Then by the time I was done with that it was after business hours so I had to wait until today. That was something I normally would have been able to remember and I would have done it. But you got distracted.
1578	Yeah, we dealt with this in several different conversations also in the sense that like this is definitely related to the of something in the sense that Yes. We're all going to die. What does ideal even mean in that context? Or bounded in the vastness of time and space and what sense does a small concept of ideal how does that fit there?
1626	"Oh, I can deal with this situation." And but then it explodes in my face. Or it scares me. It was scarier than explosives. It was more like I don't know it might change into a ghost or witch or something. And... Things are not what they seem. Yea. And then it was like a game. I don't know, maybe in a haunted house or something or not really because everything was bright and stuff. But then you go up close and then just kind of change. And I didn't know how to deal with it or David was dealing with them for me. So yea.
1633	and then I remember I went to go hang out with my soccer friends and I was like, "I just tried cocaine and nothing happened," and they were pissed. They wanted nothing to do with it and they didn't want me to have anything to do with it. Throughout sophomore year, I never snorted cocaine around the
1639	I know you're having a lot of panic and it's really uncomfortable but I don't know how adding another issue on top of that is going to make you feel better. Well, it's not like anything I'm currently doing is really effectively managing the panic. That's true. You seem to be having a lot of trouble finding something that will abate what's going on. Like I've been on the reduced Wellbutrins and it's not. So this is like the sixth day of being on reduced Wellbutrin and like I can't really see much of an effect. Like
1641	The doctor you mean? Yeah. I'm just wondering if there's a way we can kind of get in to it more to see what you imagined it felt like. Aversion is such a visceral response. I can, I actually can think of it more with my father only because it was later. I was really young and I don't know what I really felt then. I know I had an issue as I got older with my father wanting to, you know, put his arm around me. Would you sort of move away? Yeah. I could feel the aversion. What would happen if you let him touch you?
1645	Thanks. Yeah. It’s certainly not the case for James and it’s certainly like every once in a while, we’ll have an explicit conversation about it where I’ll say, “James, this is how I work. When I’m having a good day it looks really different than when I’m having a bad day. I can’t see anything outside of my emotions” I think it makes things very confusing for him. It makes things very confusing for me also at times.
1773	Would you, if you had a theory about what would happen to me. Give me the answer you thought I needed rather than the true answer. That’s part of the question, would you lie to me. So I guess it has two parts to it. You wanted to harvest more; harvest. You’re doing just fine on your own. Oh, but I’m done. Those are all the things that I traced out to present.
1797	Yeah, that's definitely true. Yeah, I guess I'm still stuck on, can't know. Yeah, I definitely feel that my anger can be destructive. I guess I've told you before that I've... sometimes when I'm very angry I want to smash everything. I don't, but that's a control thing. I don't do it, not, I don't want to do it. So yeah, I feel like it could easily be destructive if I were to let it. And so that's certainly a component here, or it feels like it. But I'm... I guess I'm...
1818	Really investigating it instead of just, like, giving you a performance of, "This is what I should say to Debbie when she comes," really doing my own... Mm-hmm. Well, meaning that I in other words, if you give me homework,
1821	All right, all right. It is. It is really interesting. It is really interesting I am just I think the connections are slow going on up here, but I think it is... It is not. See what you just did? You were demanding you should get it in a flash. Well, no, because I thought that I was under the impression that, when we spoke,
1834	Sorry, I said it and I sort of saw you grab on to that one. I think you should and I understand why you would, but yes. But this doesn’t come there are not intense moment of danger, implying that. Yes, I know. Yes, so there are certain topics that like set Tanya off
1848	I mean, in reality, I guess I'm not doing everything. Sometimes he does things but I think, I still think it's pretty unbalanced. It feels a bit lopsided. Yeah. It's not like I take down and write every time I've cooked or he's cooked dinner for me or stuff. So... I could be wrong about this but I don't think I am. That's... Certainly it's the story that I've been hearing in here for quite a while. Yeah.
1862	But, today, I heard you, and and so we've just done what we've done, and you've gone, "Wow." Yeah, that is wow. OK, so what what did we just do? Did the work to find out what the thoughts were and discover... Right. So what stage is that? Oh, that is oh, that is that is disputing. Now,
1872	that's my point of giving up because I don't want to sit and wait for three hours for a website to load and wonder if the application even got in. So I don't actually... And then that one was posted on like the like Archives listserv thing anyways so a bunch of other archivists were also applying. So... I think it wasn't the end of the world not to apply for it. And it was... And it wasn't something that I was like really, really excited about. So...
1894	You know, just sort of frantically racing through my options, and if I do this, then this will happen, and if I do this, then this will happen, and these are the things that might happen; these are the things that probably won’t happen. Like I just can’t – I can’t come up with one where that doesn’t keep. You know, that the best I can come with is, things get better for awhile. Which at this point is not so bad. I have lots of
1899	she hoped that maybe now, Madison would learn a lesson about peeing in the bed; having to sleep in pissed-smelling sheets. And I was just like so horrified; so immensely horrified, like, “Sure, you want to teach your kid not to wet the bed.” And since Madison had been sleeping completely dry for like two years, like, it’s pretty clearly acting out, because she’s unhappy about the divorce. But the answer is
1907	But there are all these people with alerts at $100 so I put it in at $99, so we'll see if someone buys it today. Tomorrow is the last day. But I knew that was going to be my problem, selling the ticket when people want to watch the game. Right. You know, it's a 6.30 game. Right. Everybody is going to be in the same situation as you.
1931	In a way, the irony is, as far as I can tell, like that’s why we all have jobs, is because of the difference. So today is Ash Wednesday. Right. Which I don’t know how much you know about this, but I’m going to go to church this evening, and they’re going to take some ashes, and
1933	Mm hmm.So the new foster mom, her name is Kelly. And she’s, she gave birth to the kittens a week ago today, or a week ago yesterday. And like right before she was giving birth…like she started acting like really crazy like, you know, like she had been really nice and letting people pet her, but like acting crazy like if you stop petting her she’ll attack you.
1957	They won’t be able to get you any food, lets.... Ok, now let’s get back to this, this is important. - Yes that’s a good idea, yep ok. This is why I’m here to talk to you about this...- Right. Ok, to tell you what’s going on. Ok tell me a bit about this then.
2007	The one you signed here is a two-way release so she may want you to have one for her records, but you're technically covered. Okay. And, you know I'm happy that I talked more with her but you'd I think you do an excellent job staying on communication with both of us. A lot of times people are unsure about
2010	Yeah. Or Scheherazade. The Arabian Nights? Oh. I'll kill you in the morning? Is that right. Yeah. I mean sometimes it's been the kind of downer "this is your dirt cloud on a sunny day" thought and sometimes it's been literally the only thing that's kept me from doing something right now, but... You'll still have the option. Right. I can always change my mind about living tomorrow.
2017	I think part of it is that most people, not necessarily me, but most people will sort of tell you or tell you, an arbitrary person, the things that I wish they’re excited but won’t necessarily say the things they’re excited about that have been hard. That’s where I think this sort of idea that being aware of someone else’s troubles is an important thing because may or may not like come out with it, but they almost certainly want to talk about it
2031	Yeah. Do you know what I mean? No. Yes, it sounds accurate, actually, to what I'm feeling. And one of the biggest things that I, it doesn't feel fair to criticize, but in finding that our expectations, my expectations which he said were totally on board. Like he was on board with them. Uh huh. They were correct. Ah. He led me to believe this was all how it was going to be. Yep. He even can acknowledge that. Right.
2032	Well my mother died right after we were married about eleven years ago. Or maybe ten it was right before I started my position with the accounting firm. My father passed just before we were married, while I was still in college. My siblings are both living and healthy. Do you think the counting and washing increased before you started your job? Well...yes it did. Before your mother passed?
2037	One was ridiculously long and the forms were all mixed up and not labeled with the name of the form. I finally found the form that said Customs Declaration. I spent time filling it out while people behind me skipped me in line to go ahead while I was writing. I finally get to the table and the guy is like, "This is the wrong form." I was like, "Okay. What form do I need?" "Go back and get the Customs form." It says "Customs Form".
2043	Yeah, I heard it. The whole thing. It was awful. And I was thinking I should go over there until he started sort of talking about me kind of, in a sideways way. I mean he is terrible at talking about something like that. His mom is ten times worse. The conversation was one of the most painful things I that I've ever listened to. And, I'm not sure anything came out of it. That's too bad. I mean it didn't end badly. It just kind of ended uncomfortably. How did Josh feel about it?
2048	"Don't you want to play?" She went, "Mama, mama, mama, mama." So I just sat down and waited it out. Luckily Jess was only ten minutes. It's hard being the daddy. Yeah. She doesn't see me often enough. How often do you see her? I haven't seen her since Saturday. Once or twice a week? Yeah, and not always for long periods of time. Sometimes she won't interact with me if she's cranky.
2053	And that may be what's scary right now is how little sense he has about the future. Mm hm. Yeah, it does not feel good, especially for someone like me who feels like they need to be in control. Of everything. Right. Sure. I feel like I have to have a pretty clear plan.
2087	Fine. This is all new. This is foreign territory. I've never done anything like this before. I'm doing everything I'm taking a risk by choosing this opportunity to benefit fromREBT in my life, because I think it is something for the better for me, but I don't have to necessarily get it or know it right away, or even in 12 sessions. It might take 12 sessions to understand it and then another, maybe, 12
2107	And also, among the other things in that statement, it’s like, so Cambridge students not taking the bus, not knowing how to get to a poor area of town, or areas where there’s black people... There’s a whole lot going on with that statement. And so I was thinking about that when she was sort of going on talking about some other things at various points, where I was just like, “But, how did you just say that?” So...
2127	It occurred to me this morning that even if I had stayed at Brown and James hadn’t moved us here, we would still be in this position at this point where I really didn’t want to do a post doc, so I guess it’s a little bit reassuring. It would still be tougher now. We are supposed to go to this party with most of James’s friends from grad school who are in the Denver area this weekend.
2140	But it would be hard for me to articulate. Nothing sort of comes to mind at the moment. It might. What do you do, while I am... thinking, over there? Hmm! Do, in terms of what I do think about?
2164	Yeah. Like it’s disruptive and it’s stressful, especially the kid starts shrieking like high-pitched loud wailing, and it’s just like it’s pitiful to be over there.
2175	When you’re this way, at least to me, it doesn’t seem like you’re kind of as possessed by the things that you feel or, perhaps, you what those things are. You’re talking about how it might be really nice to move, but I’m not really sure why. It’s not that I don’t believe you, but I don’t know what you really have in mind about the changes. I guess you mentioned that it might be easier to get a job, but I don’t expect that’s all of what you meant.
2193	...I'll nobody will really be interested in coming to see me. And if they don't, then...? ...I won't have a job. And if I don't, then...? Then I won't have any money. And then? I won't be able to afford all of my nice things. And then? And then I will be severely depressed and on the street. I don't know.
2195	Yeah, sometimes it almost is reinforcing, certainly the fear has its seed in there, and then he doesn't do that thing and so it sort of reinforces in his mind that he can't. He probably feels a little bit of anxiety relief when he avoids the thing that he's afraid of; but he might actually feel better if he could confront some of those fears and see that actually he is more capable than he believes himself to be. Maybe. I don't want to make those assumptions for him, though.
2235	You know that you're going to keep yourself safe, so you don't really need him to tell you not to do those things because it sounds like you're very clear that they are very vague thoughts that you're not acting on. If there's ever a point in time where you feel like you might act on them, then you need to tell someone because you need them to take steps to get to some safe place.
2296	And then what does that number do then? That number corresponds to numbers I’ve got on my, on my chart at home. I’ve got a big chart on my wall...- Right. - ...and I find that number - Ok. ...and that adds up to something else. - Huh. It’s, it’s, all there, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s really good, I’m gonna get one of those. What’s that?
2344	I'm not sure how much better I do feel, but certainly better enough to be out of the hospital. That's a good thing. Good. Yeah, that's a really good thing. Is your mind just kind of blank? Yeah, kind of. Has it been that way? I mean is that an accumulating thing? Is it being here? Is it...? It could be. I doubt it is, but I don't...yeah.
2348	I guess I feel like he has no clue and that's not something that is so acceptable to me. And that's another, where it's easier with my Dad. My Dad has never had a different career. Yeah. Like he's never been unemployed since he was, you know, a teenager. Before then, I mean he just never, just - Mm. Yeah. That's hard to take.
2367	Yeah, well, assuming not rush hour. But it's enough to stop me from just doing it. I mean, that also could be the... I mean, I have gone to my place for a few hours and dyed yarn. So... I don't know. I could apply for jobs when I'm at his place and dye yarn when I'm at my place or something. But as of yet, I haven't gotten a good system to motivate myself other than the, you know, I will apply to one job a week system which...
2372	You've got to do what they call a go-see-it where they went to the fire department. Something with your family. I think some of the activities they do qualify. Helping out the old folks and giving them cookies and make Christmas cards for them, you know. I think that's the community event. But stupidly I told him "Oh, you're going to get your badge."
2390	and was so down I felt like I had a good number of months but it was still teetering on like any moment, you know, there was still fear of course, I was traumatized by what had occurred, or I'll say it REBT way I traumatized myself by what happened but regardless
2391	is a thing that helps you feel better which is true and a nice observation. But he also then like brought that to our relationship in the context that like maybe she would feel better if she felt like she could take care of me which is definitely a thing that she says or believes or wants to do, which eventually to me,
2450	not knowing what your job options are going to be kind of leaves you feeling trapped financially. So the more places we can look for like well what are…what are the little choices that you can make?
10004	remember the first time I tried it was, it was like almost the last week of freshman year and
10042	Hello there, I’m one of the new physicians in the practice... First of all, what would you like me to call you? Oh, June’s fine, yeah. Ok. Right, so what is it that’s brought you to see me today? Well, it’s the same thing that I see Dr. Jones about, it’s my heart. Yeah, yeah, I understand that you’ve been in to see him a few times over the last few months.
10101	But like whenever we hang out, it’s just this constant stream of like, “I can’t write; I’m so blogged; I have all these projects; they’re all behind deadline; I feel so terrible; my house is a shithole. But no, don’t help me clean it, because I’m too embarrassed to let anyone help me clean it. But I’m just going to tell you about how miserable I am that it’s a shithole.” While we’re sitting in the middle
10104	how much I was exercising. So I was like, okay I'm going to eat more but I'm going to exercise more. It wasn't until I went abroad, to Geneva, that I really put the weight back on, because I joined a soccer team, but the season ended early, so I pretty much stopped working out, started drinking again and started binge eating. Not eating but just binge eating. Oh, yeah, binge eating.
10120	Yes, to the last part. I have... not a lot to say there, but I think that’s probably the place we should, the thing we should talk about. But thank you for the direct answer also. That was very interesting and it very much matches my experience of like... how you interact with me. You know, you’ll often say something like, “This came to my mind.” Which is... entirely consistent with what you just said, that it, you know... So thanks for sharing that. I appreciate now what’s going on.
10136	...to find out if there is some sort of stipend or salary or something that goes along with it. Yeah. But, you know, if you're not interested in doing the work... Yeah. ...and you wouldn't apply for it if it were a paid position. Though if something is a paid position, don't you think it would be to their advantage to be like, "This is a paid internship," because, you know, more people would be likely to apply if it were paid then unpaid? I'm not willing to speculate.
10144	No I'm not. I make my own decisions, I have my own discretion, but I think that when I'm feeling desperate I think it's more that... When you're making yourself desperate by telling yourself what? That I'm never going to be the same again and very many should's and musts and all those things.
10166	I think that’s part of it. I think those are all like important things and I am glad to have said them and thought about them. I think they are important. But none of them; none of those or any of the other things, many things that I’ve said on this topic actually get to like how did it come to be the case that I asked that question?
10168	The second thing I want to mention in relation to what you said about ten minutes ago, when you said that you feel depressed tell me: that is the cue for us asking yourself "what?" What or why? What. What would you ask yourself when you recognize that you are feeling depressed. What is the mantra when we recognize we're feeling an unhealthy emotion? That I'm a fallible human...
10182	Yeah, it was just kind of weird. Yeah. So, also, there’s going to be a whole week of this, and I had planned to be supportive and show my face and now I’m thinking “You know, I don’t have to do that”. Especially since, like, so there’s been super low turnout, and people in the building haven’t bothered to show, so I think I... Yeah, you’re done. Yeah. Okay. I’m going to continue thinking on your comment of was I just getting super critical because I was mad.
10185	do you feel like one makes sense of emotions in the same way, over time? Is there a different... set of... constructs or tools or... features about oneself that allow him to process emotional or emotions, feelings? I don’t know how to answer that off the bat. What do you think? It sounds like you had some thoughts behind, at, in terms of just even constructing the question as you did.
10194	As you're comfortable doing that you can scan your body again noticing any places where it might feel different than it felt before. No need to judge the feelings. No need to judge if it's the same or different. Just noticing it. And now just let yourself return to normal breath, inhales and exhales at whatever pace feels natural to you. And then let yourself return to the room, let go of your focus.
10203	And the sort of ... there’s a significant　downside of... like I am acquainted or passingly familiar or friends with a ton of people there,　so there’s, like if I’m sitting there talking to someone, there’s always a string of people that are　like “Hey, how are you, blah blah blah” and it was just like “Hello, but I’d really like you to go　away right now”. Or just, like, it was hard to just sort of hang out and talk to a few people　quietly. Other than like, my hotel room.
10224	But what...so what's missing? He would have a response in the moment that was empathic, it sounds like he would say "I'm sorry," but he wouldn't be able to be...to offer more of something? Is that what you're looking for? Like somebody who's going to? I don't know but I'm... Because nobody's going to be able to fix this situation. No, no and I'm not expecting a fix but what I'm saying is like I feel pretty overwhelmed and every day, truly yesterday
10263	Yeah, where you feel you have this fantasy that you're completely helpless. Fantasy? Yeah. "Oh my god, I have no fucking clue what I'm doing with the pinewood derby car. They don't give us much direction. The scout leader is kind of scatterbrained. I don't know if we have the paint to paint on wood. It's this Saturday, five days from now, whatever."
10290	It can't get much faster especially or example let's say Dr. Board says "Okay, Ramona wants you to get testing I'm going to come in and tell you you need to get tested." If he does that in that poorly timed way Ivan's going to say "What?" and never go back to see him again. So he's got to also pace himself even if he agrees with you that that's a really good idea and agrees with me even with psychopharm,
10300	when you were trying to apply for jobs. All the way from the beginning was that you were going expect something was going to work out within the first month or two even. Mm hm. Pretty much every single person who applies for a job in whatever field right now, the average time to get a job is six to eight months at least. Right? That is the state of affairs in employment. It's incredibly competitive. There are people applying for jobs who are extremely over qualified. There are people who are applying for jobs that then get filled internally.
10334	So then I was in this position of do I sit there and blunder about what's going on or I could tell him; and that seemed clearly less bad. But there's a sense in which it's not so much that he could handle it better, but it wasn't as painful for him, if that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, I think that's right. I think what I'm doing is just quibbling a little bit about your suggestion or I'm suggesting a way in which they might be able to handle it better.
10346	And he just keeps saying "I don't want that, I don't need that, I don't want that, I don't need that." No one is there to see that he can't do it on his own. But you don't let him try so we don't see what will happen if you don't do that. Do you know what I mean? But I mean Tuesday morning I woke up and we had warm food because he couldn't remember to close the fridge.
10435	with only supervised visits for her, because she’s not like – Christopher is also permissive, and doesn’t discipline the kid, but at least like he keeps his house clean, and the kid isn’t living in filth. Yeah.
10444	Now that I just, I'm like, I don't know. I'm already taking one medicine, so what's going to happen if I take another. I don't like all that chemicals in my body, I don't know. Does it feel like it's contaminating you somehow? It gives me that same feeling as when...
10466	Yes, so then you spoke to me, and I have to say thank you for that because it definitely helped in the moment when I was in this sort of state of mass hysteria, it definitely, I felt calmed after our talk and everything. Share now what it was that allowed you to change your desperation to calmness.
10479	"Oh, we're going to sleep at my place tonight," then it's like, "Oh, I'm too sick to go over," and then I'm like, "Okay, fine. We stay at your place another night and, you know..." It's a lot harder to motivate myself to go over to my place and dye yarn then to already by at my place and then dye yarn because it's a whole like fifteen minute drive to my place and then I have to drive back. I guess it's not that long of a drive but like it's still... It doesn't sound like a very long commute.
10483	How are you? I'm okay, I think. I don't know. I'm kind of not sure. I feel okay today. I don't know. I think I'm definitely kind of mildly depressed or something. I feel tired. I was just a crazy . . . I was already feeling a little off before all of this shit happened so . . . What was it like for you Friday? It was crazy. It was definitely traumatizing, there's no question.
10494	Yeah, because that was just like, I did this panel, I’m like “Oh, I hate everyone”, basically, and then I left, and hung out with friends, and then and it was more like, parts were definitely fun, and I did like, there are usually a dozen parties happening or so, and I didn’t go to any of them this year. I just was so, A) I can’t drink anything, but B) I just was sort of like,
10506	And if she does? And if you do, it is not the end of the world, and you'll survive as will I. No one is going to die... Probably. ...Because I was a couple minutes late. We hope. Yeah, we hope. I'm joking. OK. You realized that, right? Yeah, I did. And then what was the second one was that I was
10525	like lowering the Wellbbutrin stops the taking more Klonopin. It's one at a time so, yeah, I guess I could call her and ask about the intermediate stuff of spreading out the Klonopin more and whether or not it would work because like, I think it's like you know low enough that it doesn't like cause me to be too tired during the day. I have been, I mean I've gotten tired lately but not in the morning when I take the Klonopin. I think it's more just like all the panic is making me tired.
10557	Like I don't really think that you would argue that you know using chemical weapons in Syria was a good thing or an okay thing. Oh, I don't want to get rid of the category, not okay. I certainly hope I didn't mean to imply that at all. No, I didn't really take you to be but that was what I was asking you if you left not ideal unbounded.
10558	Yeah. No, I'm just giving you shit. Oh. So, yeah. Yeah. No, I'm sorry, I probably should have — I know it's one of those things, and it's come up and I think we even talked about it before. Yeah. I think we have talked about it because it came up at the hospital or somewhere else it came up. If I missed it, I'm sorry.
10600	And build up the front. I don't know. He wants to put football stickers on it. I went to the Cub Scout store to look for some stickers, but nothing really jumped out at him. Except all the badges and pins and buckles. Yeah. He was supposed to get a badge, but there was a miscommunication among the Scout leaders and he didn't get it. Oh no. What does he have to do to get it? I'm really not even sure.
10619	and he's driving on his way to a call. Mm hm. But he's incredibly supportive. He was incredibly supportive when I was going to school. If I wanted to do another program tomorrow he would be ridiculously supportive of it. Hm. Not financially or anything. But he would just always want to ask about it, be encouraging.
10633	who's depressed. And the draining part, is it that you get little of what you need, or is it that being around that sort of mood or atmosphere brings you down? Yeah, I mean, I think those are related things. Yeah, I think it's not strictly fair to say I get little of what I need. I think maybe it's better to say I cannot predict when I will get anything that I need. Or when it will be like, no, having needs is totally unacceptable, or intolerable or something.
10644	He immediately came and asked me if he'd done a good job. Like, ‘I don't know.' The two of you. We may said some things without meaning to, like, ‘I want you to be taken care of when you're old and not be a burden.' Kind of like, ‘I don't want your problems,' some sort of to things and he tried to fix it but ended up asking her if she wanted us to take
10650	you know, volunteer there. I guess also the that we gave to her. So... If I see a job there I could like talk to the people but it's like until I see that job.
10653	I have a heating pad. Of course I wouldn’t know where it is. I think it’s one of the boxes that I haven’t gone into yet. Okay, so when it becomes available, you can try it out. You have a shower. Or you can run some hot water over a towel, put a towel in a plastic bag and lay that over your chest and it will be warm for a little bit.
10724	You said it would be better for James, although again I’m not sure why and I can certainly see how, if it would be better for him, it would also be better for you. It seems somehow it’s a little less clear to me so far. In some ways, I feel like when I’m doing well it’s very common for me to want to be doing something else, to be like I want to explore. I want to go someplace else and see what else is out there.
10739	or the difficulties; that they have driven like a negative valance. You know like knowing a lot of other pregnant women and how difficult it is and like kind of along that vein. And I was sort of struck by that.
10757	here's where we are. Were there particular vows that were especially hard to hear? So in the service they do this strange thing where they do a declaration of intent, and then they actually do the vows. And they're, like, separate parts of the ceremony, presumably to ensure that the person they're forcing to get married isn't being forced to get married. That's why they have to declare their own intent. It's all historical and kind of silly. And then that part... that's the part that contains the forsaking all others piece.
10810	it's like so, yes, the concerns are more dire then. I guess I feel like you made a statement and I mostly agree with the statement and so I'm not sure what to say in response. Yeah, I think that's an accurate assessment. It does not feel particularly free to say that I found this upsetting, not that I can completely hide from her when I find something upsetting but So are you saying 'nowhere to go' it's like you don't have any train of thoughts or you don't know what to do about it or?
10814	Yes. And you have the freedom and choice to imperfectly, step-by-step, work on creating a healthier inner emotional life. Yay! So dwell on what you didn't know and how you suffered or think about "I'm already changing myself at times, and I can continue to" your choice. OK. Yes.
10852	Have you ever been suicidal? Obviously my wife has been for a while and that has changed, radically, my view of her. I find myself unable, although that’s not strictly correct, to trust her. Unwillingly, certainly hard. And so it’s a sense in which the answer to that question has the possibility to shake me in some deep way.
10858	Right now you've got you way of expressing how badly you feel. Give it a shot. Don't wait until it's really bad. Just practice asking for the hugs even if it doesn't get that bad, so that we can train him to give that kind of support that you actually really want and let's see how that goes. Then I think we meet next week at the same time. Do we have the rest of July scheduled?
10867	whether I have like... suggested to you that I think what you do is random, because I don’t, I don’t that’s how I think about it, but...
10868	But Dr. Board's also going to have to find a way of bringing this up in ways that are palatable and manageable for him too and it might take some time to do that. So I might say to you if you can even, until we meet next, not bring anything up and I'm saying this, not going to work, your marriage is not going to work if that's what happens in the long run
10878	the perfect solution to your maladies, and that you're still suffering some physical consequences? No, no. Because you are...? Because I'm seeking out what to... You're doing... I'm doing something about it. Yes. I'm not just... There is no perfect solution, perhaps? There is no perfect solution.
10886	Is it that your time will help more on a lower dose of Wellbutrin? Not really. Like it was just step one, step two and then wait 'til then - Well, then that's why you're checking with her to see what - Yeah, it was just a week you know, okay so I did the, you know, switching to a lower Wellbutrin like a day or two early, but now it's been almost two weeks since the appointment with the week of the Klonopin, the week of the lower Wellbutrin. It's not
10924	hope, the willingness to continue to be gentler on yourself and unconditionally accepting, and at peace with you as an imperfect human being like the rest of us an imperfect human being who is blessed with many gifts, by the way. It is not about not enjoying your assets. Right. Celebrate them. Enjoy them. Right.
10927	at least a little bit. Having to acknowledge that this is hard or exists. There are probably a lot of other ways to tackle this metaphor, but those are my first responses. And do you feel that’s somebody that I would want to do to?
10930	I think that a lot has happened recently and more historically in your life that sort of, in reality, adds to the impression that anybody who thinks they have reasons doesn't know what they're talking about. Like it may not be. I'm just going to throw it out there though anyway and we'll think about it. So there may be times when your feelings are so intent and you come on, in your kind of subtle way, so strongly with them that you
10970	like one way our relationship is skewed. And then another is that like you just don’t talk much about yours. One of the struggles over the last several weeks is I feel like has been trying to, for me, trying to like take away the barriers to intimacy that I have made so that the ones that remain are natural in some sense of the ones that you aren’t supposed to like the ones I’ve made up for you to
10971	Sorry I'm late. I was wondering if today was going to be the day that — What's that? If today was going to be the day that I was on time?  Yeah. Good morning. Good morning. So Micah gave me a prescription for Adderall. Hmmm.
11013	I didn't have anyone to go to the game with so I sent out an e-mail. Now I'm getting all of these e-mails. Is it time? Are we done? Not yet. There was a lot of traffic, too. Does this feel like just something else you just had to do this morning?
11018	Usually I'm pretty comfortable being mad and critical at the sermons. I have been kind of the skeptic in the pew for a long time, but on this topic I'm anxious about it. I would really like this to mean something, but I just don't think it does. What do you mean by its meaning something? In other words, I guess one of the things that occurs to me is one sort of meaning, which is often the way we talk about it, is more like how does it work?
11023	it’s missing a piece, but that sort of how Tanya will fare in the future. If you take that variable out and say what if that doesn’t matter that much? I mean I is this the marriage that you want to be in now, and are there enough things about Tanya that you love and value? And are there enough parts of your moral system that you feel committed to that this is the marriage that you want to be in?
11048	Like it is not so simple as, "I should be a good student." It is, "And if I'm not like -" in other words, all the worst possible, putting it all out there in terms of what I really think, not just going by the books and looking at the homework of... So being more thorough in your expression of your irrational beliefs? Exactly. Mm-hmm.
11053	Yeah, I would have that diagnosed by a — you know, the best bet is a neuropsychologist who does testing or at least a screening. The second best bet is an actual mental health clinician. It could be a social worker, psychologist or psychiatrist. Way to poo-poo on her parade. She's had this appointment for six months. What do you want me to say?
11057	Yeah, that was I was intending to give reasons not to have that conversation in the moment when I'm angry, and she has like in that moment. You're first qualifying statement was not commenting on the time scale. These are reasons to have that conversation and that sounds right. And so I guess now we're at the point of needing to talk about the time scale because I think
11081	I guess. I'm not totally in touch with that, because I also feel at the same time that I'm lucky to have what I have and I know there are people that are a lot worse off than I am and I'll manage somehow. I may have to work until I'm 80, but I don't. I mean if there is anger about that, I'm sure there probably is, I'm not in touch with it at all. I'm more feeling. I'm feeling it more, I think, directed to Harold because I feel he has this opportunity and he's not really enjoying it and appreciating it the way I think I would.
11088	So the following week has been a little bit strange. So... yeah. A whole lot of people have been excited for me and congratulatory and all of that. It took me most of Wednesday to fly back, most of Wednesday to fly back last week, because when I booked the flights I was... A lot of travel. I had sort of thought that I would be very pleased afterwards. And certainly after I finished the dissertation and sent it off I had very like intensely peaceful feelings. That was really nice.
11091	It sounds like to feel comfortable in a place you need to hold out. I wonder if having a conversation with his roommates might put you at ease to know what they're really thinking. I kind of really don't want to because I'm just afraid what would happen if they say, "Oh, actually we are really pissed that you are over all the time." There's not much I can do about that. Well, you could ask, "Is there a way to make it more comfortable?"
11138	Well maybe that's a plan to try, thinking about what you say to elicit the kind of response that you want. I just figured it would probably be impossible anyway. Well, let's give it a try before we decide it's impossible. That would probably help. It sounds like what you want is some comfort, not an argument. I've told him so many times, "If you say that, that's not actually going to make me feel better. Can you stop saying that?"
11140	How did they do it? How do they ignore all the crap and do what they want to do? I'm always looking for that. But I also end up looking at, "Oh, they have this thing that I never had." That cannot I cannot do anything about that so... I mean, we all compare ourselves to each other all the time, right? Or that's like some people like me who are insecure do that all do it more often. I mean... That's true.
11175	Yeah. I just don't want to have to pay hundreds of dollars. It's not like I'm blind or anything with these so . . . like I've been doing this not being able to see things so, yeah, I could . . . His place is really hard to deal with when it's that messy, when I can feel the dirt on my feet; and I don't think I'm especially . . . he thinks maybe it's my OCD or whatever; but I don't
11187	That’s exactly what her mother did to her. So there are some real similarities between her and her mother. Some of those are presumed genetic and some of those are presumably, I believe like, angry person raises children and turns them in to angry people and they raise children and turn them in to like…the damage seems to propagate regardless of the genetics of the situation also.
11191	joke, and that was fine. I guess like I can’t it’s hard – it feels sort of hard for me to understand that like people can’t see that in me. Like that she wouldn’t have ever been around me in a context where like like she would know that that’s what it’s like. I don’t –
11200	light switch or a faucet handle. I usually use a paper towel to open things so I don’t have to touch anything directly. If I touch something and I don’t wash three times, then I am afraid that I will get germs that could cause me to get sick. I have fears that I forget to lock the door or turn off lights, so I will go and turn the lock three times and then need to wash my hands three times.
11204	Which means I think that that either he maybe was right. I mean because I too also wonder if you I don’t entirely – well, I wonder about the extent to which you feel like you’ve done something terribly wrong, or you deserve sort of maybe like really angry or punishing, because you will allow yourself to really be taken care of. And to kind of like
11211	That’s fine, and I’ll see you next week. Ok, thank you Doctor.
11255	it wasn't exactly what you said. So, next time, maybe just be a little bit more cautious before you start sharing information with people, that you think might be in their best interests but really isn't exactly what is the reality." And I was pretty assertive with him, which is new for me. So I guess, if I want to focus on what I did yeah. Well done. So, yeah, that felt good, actually.
11264	So that does one thing. And then like feeling like it's a burden to ask for anything is another thing. Yeah, if I don't distance myself from her, at least internally, then yeah, it is-it is-does impact my mood for her mood to be low. But then if I distance from her internally then we're distant in some sense. And that itself is like not necessarily what I want in a relationship. And I'm not saying like I want our moods to be tightly coupled at all times, but like isn't that a feature of relationships? Like shared experience, or something like that?
11308	I didn't mean to disturb your reverie. No, that's okay. Thanks very much. Okay. So I will see you in two weeks. Okay. Good luck next week at your conference. It'll go fine. I'm sure it will. All right. Bye. Sure.
11343	Okay, so basically all the stuff I end of fighting against. Okay. Yeah. And so cognitive behavioral therapy is what most people recommend for anxiety because it works for lots of people to manage the symptoms and you struggle against it but I keep sneaking it in there and I hope that at some point it will take hold for you and that you'll be able to get use out of it. But they're hard for you. Yeah.
11372	If we're just calling that basically seeing and caring about the life of another person. It's fundamental to every healthy relationship. Not something you need to get over. That's what you want to be a part of your marriage. And you want it to be reciprocal. That's what's different about it not being motherly. Right? In that place it's the mother's job to be that caring and concerned for the child, and for the child not necessarily, early on, to have to even think about how the mother is doing so much.
11383	Um hmm. Although the bottom floor of not ideal is really bad. Right. And I think I was more commenting that in listening to you, not ideal is often equivalent with not okay, or not encompassing a broader range. You may be right. You listen to me and you listen very, very well.
11420	think waiting for the next bad thing to happen is trauma.
11424	I see. I don't question it, but I take your point. It's your view that you're kind of doing it too much to him. I don't know how to evaluate that in a sense because, on the one hand, I know you're having a very hard time and there's been tough stuff at work, you're sleeping five hours a night. Maybe we haven't talked much about that because I don't remember some of that; or maybe it was a while ago and I forgot who knows. Anyway, whatever. The point is, clearly you're having a very shitty time and it certainly makes sense to me that that could lead one to dump more on their spouse.
11433	Ahh stuff that changes this mysterious brain chemistry. There's no way to measure. Things that you hear about on drug commercials and on TV and they talk about serotonin levels and norepinephrine, there aren't really ways we have to go in and measure what levels are or what the right levels are. It's an idea, but there aren't really these specifics.
11436	Yeah, if I remember. But I pick Ian up today. Jess's taking some knitting class or something like that, you know. She complains that she has no time to get work done and she's so overwhelmed and, you know, I don't know. But taking a knitting class in the middle of the day? She takes all of Friday off with Lucille.
11461	So, it's, I don't know. I can't. I don't want to know if I can say it's better. It depends. Some days better. Some days not. You know, I think the other thing is the feeling, the first feeling that I think I can get in touch with is anger and I don't want to, you know, feel it. I just feel like this whole thing with Harold just has, you know, built up in me for a long time. Just anger at him not feeling well.
11541	She's unhappy most of the time, and that... And I guess I feel like I don't really trust her to... at all. Like I just... I meant to say more there, but then that seemed like the appropriate place for a period. But that's not ultimately what makes you feel trapped. Because you're trapped by your sense of obligation.
11546	and Amy are gone, Aaron is on grocery shopping. There's maybe a box of pasta in the downstairs area where there should be all the pasta, so Aaron hasn't really been keeping up. Eating at my place would require a lot more planning and stuff and doesn't really work when I've just gotten home from work and it's like, "Oh, we have two hours." Yeah, that one is a problem. If I'm going to spend more time at my place it would probably be on the nights that I don't have work.
11563	Even in my own university, I was with him. And he and I were traveling together. So yea, I mean, in a place like India, it's a bit risky for a single woman to go about on her own. I mean, they do it all the time. But it's just like I haven't been there in a long time. So it for me, it's a bit scary. So it's nice that he was there with me. Yea, but how can I feel secure if I have if I'm a sidekick. Well, it's funny. Isn't it funny? It's ironic because he's there to make me feel secure. But then I feel insecure because I'm not the hero myself. I'm not Batman.
11605	think any suggestion of 'this is a thing that is contributing to your mood,' taps into that emotion. It is this pedantic? I think so. Yeah. All these things seem like great openings to conversations. Like, if she does feel like you're being pedantic, maybe there's information in that. You're being pedantic, taking that you
11625	It's hard for me to think about just the possibility that greater understanding wouldn't be helpful. I mean I feel like it's kind of one of the foundational principles of life that like knowing is better. Yeah, knowing will help. I think when it comes to this stuff, I think you want to think knowing won't help, because I think you don't want to know. We kind of know where a bunch of the bodies are buried at this point. I mean, there's a lot more to learn.
11626	Yeah. Nothing adds up. So, I just want to stay away from it. I must have read four-hundred pages in the last 24 hours. Mm hm. And in other ways understanding doesn't necessarily help. So... It's interesting. It's distracting sometimes.
11630	On a very basic level you can't control for all the factors that will upset her. And I appreciate your saying, well, me speaking is upsetting her. So I can choose not to speak, which is different than other things which seem more out of your control. But I think as a general approach in your marriage it's untenable, on so many levels, not the least of which is, the pent-up anger will just continue to grow. Right. Right. Yeah, I hear you, and I think you're right. I just don't...
11635	I’ve been suicidal all along. Like for the past few weeks. But not as suicidal as I was when I was not on the Seroquel. So I think it’s helping. The past few days, what, when you say suicidal, what does that really mean? How long have the thoughts been, what level have the thoughts been? Was more like I was kind of really sad, but usually like not that long. But they weren’t just like instant and go away. They were like maybe like five minutes or so.
11651	Okay. 2:30 on the 19th. Okay. Those are both saved in my calendar. And I will see you next Monday at 2:30 as well. This is your. Okay.
11684	I think that’s why people come to therapy in general, or sort of the frameworks they have for processing it are not working. There is too much new experience to incorporate and it’s not fitting in with the, you know, the... pre-existing constructs. It’s not simply intellectual, it’s emotionally, one is overwhelmed by the information. The information can be feelings and it’s not just facts
11688	Not in like I portion control or I make food the night before, but I spend all day thinking about food. Huh. I'll wake up in the morning and the first thing I think about is okay, what am I going to have for breakfast and when am I going to have it, and then what am I going to have for lunch, and if we're going out to dinner, it's like okay, what am I going to have for breakfast and lunch
11723	the least it's been, I'm taking steroids and doing all these things and so I phoned you on Friday evening because a friend of mine when I was explaining what was going on and just sort of giving him the low down he proceeded to tell me that I was too young, he says I'm way too young to have a herniated disc. He's a medical doctor?
11821	I didn't want to bring in that I'm seeing someone intimate but I said one of them said that it might be helpful for Ivan to get some kind of evaluation to find out what's going on and maybe even a pharmaceutical evaluation and just...I told him didn't know if he was aware but Ivan
11838	that foundation of just having been given to, lovingly given to. Just knowing that's part of the way loving relationships work. I think this comes up a little here with me too. But what if I were to give you, in a way, as a metaphor, a second session and help you and say, "I want to help you. I want to give this to you. I want to take care of you. I want to help you feel better." I think that's disorienting for you. Like you almost don't You're used to being, having the
11855	I know you sort of, you’ve pushed on that idea before, in suggesting that I... perhaps undervalue the extent to which the people who are doing things are doing them for a reason. That might be true. But... So in that instance, another thing that I found very frustrating about it was that everyone sort of goes through the same sequence when they meet Tanya. So it was like... they hear her story and they... seem to start constructing essentially a similar sequence of theories,
11861	"No wonder I'm, you know, kind of really impatient and ready to move on, be done with it." Yeah. And so I sometimes think that. Yeah. This example, I think, is a little complicated for good reason. Yeah. That's what you're bringing up. So, for example, I hear you also in what you're describing, "What if this never changes?" is there's still a lot of anger. Mm hm.
11886	I think trading off who gets their way might be a compromise. You get your way this time; I get my way next time or not eating together.
11949	Well, as we're driving out there I could just hear in Jess's voice when Ian called her that she didn't sound good. She's like "I'm throwing up, I've been throwing up." Oh.
11963	So you're feeling really irritable? Yeah, irritable, anxious, a lot of the anxious/anxiety uncomfortable feeling. I'm not crying non-stop, so I don't know. It's like when I had depression and I knew it was depression sophomore year I was crying non-stop and it was this big feeling sort of like a cloud over me, but it was more of a physical feeling. It was there pretty much the entire time. That's not really there.
11982	Oh, fun. So I can see Melanie. So, I will be gone a week. Okay. So, I will see you in two weeks then? Yes. Okay. Great. Take care.
11993	about some of this stuff for the first time in his life and my guess is stuff he's kept bottled up inside, mostly hasn't been put into words, will start getting put into words. That's all good stuff. Dr. Bourd is an excellent therapist, he's probably one of my top three therapists in the entire city who I would refer to. He's outstanding in his intuition about people.
12006	Yeah. Not for a long time. I didn't drink in high school. I definitely wasn't one of the popular kids who got invited to the parties, and so there was a couple times that my friends' parents would go away and we would get some beer, you know, and hang out at her house. Compared to what the other kids were doing, I was a really good kid in high school. I smoked pot for the first time when my younger brother gave it to me, the night before I went to college. He was hanging out with the cool kids in my grade, but when I got to college I started drinking a lot.
12014	but I can recognize them as they come back or something? "Come back." Meaning that they were there but they are buried. Yeah, I don't think that I ceased to have desires. I think I ceased to know what they were, but I could be wrong about that. Maybe I just stopped having any desires at all. I'm not sure. At some point I don't know that it matters like in a practical sense that I can't find them so they might as well not exist.
12027	Right. I don’t know. I was like, “Where are you,” I don’t know, “looking at?” I don’t know. But, yeah. I don’t know. So, yeah. So, yeah. Now, I just don’t know really what to do, because I—I don’t know. I don’t know. I live far away and I feel like he needs someone to push him a little bit because he’s feeling low. I don’t know. And getting job isn’t completely—I don’t know. I don’t know. But .
12040	And some of that is related to the deadlines and so forth. But part of it is I have a difficult time estimating how long something's going to take. Sometimes I do things like this, where that should not have been possible but I did it. So that makes it harder to estimate the next time how long is that task going to actually take. I have no idea how long that task should have taken now, all I can say is that it took a whole lot of work and I did it in that. So there's that piece. There's also I didn't want to reschedule it. I didn't want to because
12074	in what's getting clearer in this family system though is that you both have had sets of parents who've kind of reinforced these ways of being in the world and to find that Ivan's dad for example, here's what his son wrote, a suicide letter, and doesn't want call him,
12129	think thinking outside the box is a good idea. But thinking about pursuing a different degree that you're not interested in seems like a little bit much of an investment. Yeah. Just wondering if... Well, I don't know. I just also don't think I'm... Unless it was a PhD program that had a stipend I don't think I could justify going for another degree because they would cost money
12138	Those two I asked in particular because I had been thinking, I think the day before, I asked them; like so I’m anxious about asking those questions for, you know, reasons about me. Not about like asking too much if you…those questions, I sort of was wondering are there any questions to which the answer might fundamentally change my view of who you are or my view, my experience or my understanding of you? And so those were the two.
12145	number one wasn't even accurate and number two is in the scheme of everything that's going on it's almost, you can look at the ridiculousness of the way that he was speaking to me that he was...Oh because he did say at one point
12154	to up the level of impact in your daily life. His mood swings. This is where I also think like even if you're not going to separate spaces right now how to start develop some space for you even if you're going to be living in the same space. How to say you won't then spend the evening together, you know what I mean?
12179	I need someone. To do what? Maybe to listen, maybe to say at the end of the day say like "Oh your husband told you you're going to get a divorce, that's really..." I'm sorry, this is so stupid. It's not stupid Ramona. It's not that big of deal I'm just a little...I guess I need someone to say "That's really difficult, I'm here for you." Just something or "it must be really tough to listen to him say how hopeless it is and keep going but I'm here for you and I hear that and you're not crazy
12206	My mom was depressed and has issues. She’s never been treated. My dad is fine - no problems. No other medical issues that I know of. Was your husband physically or emotionally/mentally abusive to you?
12249	need something. Something structured for the two of you to do and reminder for yourself that even though he can't go out and go for a run or go for a hike or go for a ride with you, you can still do those things. It's important for you to do them. Have you done restorative yoga? I think I could get him to do that over meditation. He doesn't do well with sitting like in total silence around other people. Stillness.
12309	That's sounds great. And then we'll go back to Wednesdays. Okay. Okay, great. Okay, take care. Have a good Christmas, okay. Thank you, you too. Okay, take care.
12314	I think little things like I know it came up yesterday or the day before and now I can't even remember what the example was, but it was something normally I would have caught and didn't Are you forgetting to show up places where you're supposed to be? That has not happened. I'm still good at scheduling all the things. Do you find yourself losing things?
12334	I couldn't do it every night, because I was an athlete. So, you know, I didn't Tuesdays and Thursdays we had practice, and Friday nights we didn't go out, because we had games every Saturday morning. So it wasn't like an option for me to do it on soccer days. I was still as much as I liked to party, and the same went for pot and the same went for alcohol
12371	Okay, well I'll see you next week, then. Yeah. Oh, I brought my consent forms. Oh, great, thank you. Sorry, I meant to give them to you at the beginning so you could record. So now that I have a regular appointment, you just bill at the end of the month? Exactly. Great, thank you so much.
12385	That is not it. That is not it. That is not it. Yeah, it is very clear. Is it clear it is what you add to that? Very clear. All right. So what is the next step? So then the next steps so hold on it is the activating, it is the event, then it is the recognizing those beliefs, and...
12402	I don't know. I just thought about it. I don't know what made me think of this, but when I worked at Walter Reed hospital it was with kids, like 12 kids, and one of them was borderline personality disorder. You know, you spend your whole time there trying to develop relationships with them. She was obviously very difficult. One time, you know, I asked her what was going on and one time she actually told me and it was like I don't want to know. Okay. Thank you. I will never ask that question again.
12419	the existential stuff that I feel. It's just all absurd and random. Things happen. It's overwhelming. And yet, you also feel something when you think about the good outweighing the bad. No, definitely. That has an ethic and a meaning to it beyond "life is meaningless and we could all die tomorrow." No, no, no. It's not a "life is meaningless" thing. It's more, I think, just a melancholyness. That's
12435	Yeah, I don’t – none of my friends are happy and it sucks. I really miss Ashley, and I realize that part of it; well I mean, part of it is just that you know, I’m still half in love with him, and part of it is, you know, the physical and sexual aspect of the relationship. And certainly part of it was, in spite of knowing intellectually, that he was really depressed and miserable, and has been for quite awhile, he fakes being okay really well.
12444	And I think that was when she told me that her sister was bipolar and that like it had made her start to wonder also whether this was a thing that was going away or whether this what this meant. And so we both sort of sat with that for a moment and she was okay, I need to talk about something else. That’s too much, so we did. Tanya can’t do that. The sitting with it, the
12450	out to Oregon, just aimless and disassociated. I can imagine that, hopefully, on a smaller scale and, hopefully, caught that's kind of what we're here to do and help you with but I can imagine that being a piece of what's happening right now. You have enough
12479	if it doesn't take forever for me to do stuff at the bus stop like walking around for a bit until Sydney is out of his therapy today. Yesterday, actually, in the evening I walked for a half an hour. I intended it to be a small trip and then I stayed out for a half an hour. I was walking for most of that.
12482	Yeah, it's funny, because last night Kelly came over and we just hung out at home. It was really nice, but I don't know what it is, I just . . . It's like there's a part of me that just wants to retreat and just wants to be alone. I just don't know.
12497	And even that. And that was – yeah. Actually, I didn’t say I was upset about what had happened, I said that like I wouldn’t have chosen to share that much, which is not the same thing at all. I feel like my problem is really bottling up emotions; this isn’t going to help very much. I felt the same. You must feel like this means you’ve been right.
12516	Which was everyone's worry, right? He didn't say it to me or talk to me about it, he goes to my friend and then my friend was like freaking out to me after on the way home asking me why he would say that to her and how upsetting it was. So then he basically did a similar thing recently and I know he's not terrified about my brother's relationships. There's nothing terrifying about that. I mean, maybe he thinks about it but the only one not terrified of relationships. So But he can't tell you about it.
12543	I think in her case she feels like she ought to do something but isn't quite clear what it is. And that has set up some sort of guilt cycle that prevents her from speaking to me except when she's really drunk. It's not... So I guess, in thinking about the whole thing, if this were a weekend where they were all coming... because no one's life is in a particularly wonderful place right now, and everyone was like, let's just leave everything behind and have a really good time and focus on these people who are getting married, I can get behind that in some sense.
12559	But then they reject people. And one of the guys they rejected because he was upset that they that people mispronounce his name. I don't know. Well, yesterday I was feeling really, really horrible. I was walking around the streets crying. Just I just and I was actually aware of what I was doing. I was thinking of and re-thinking and re-thinking the same things. And I was feeling so victimized. And like what we talked about having that narrative constantly debilitate me.
12574	I'm hoping. I'll be upset if she doesn't, if she doesn't go, "Mama, mama, mama, mama." Stand up in the car seat and go, "No." Is that what she does? That's what she did to me. Wow. She did not want to go with me. When we got home she literally stood in the driveway and was going, "Mama, mama, mama, mama,"
12576	Yeah, sure. And I kind of whacked him on the head, you know, and he's kind of sensitive. Same thing with his bicycle helmet, you know. He starts crying when I do it, but for me it's just habit. You see a helmet, you whack it. The instructor accidentally bumped into his head when he was sitting down, and I could tell he kind of whined a little bit about that.
12582	it is like feeling as though – kind of like it’s going anywhere. And I imagine part of how that works is, probably that there’s something it feels like; I know you may well be missing about what this feels like to you to be listening to them. Like it’s – it’s exhausting, and then guilty for being exhausted by it. Yeah.
12600	it takes longer to process individual things. So I think... those two things happening at the same time... play into it and maybe makes sense in this context where... one way of describing why I’m here is that I can’t process all of what’s happening or happened, so...
12627	feels this is very stigmatized and he's very disappointed in himself if that would come up. He made that very clear. I said "I don't know if there's a way that you could somehow approach him and let him know that you guys support it and you don't...you know, there is no stigma and it's healthy and good..." He really couldn't get that maybe cause I'm like "I know you told Ivan at one point he needs to be on antidepressants," and I said "Maybe you don't do that?"
12671	And I have to believe that the truth is helpful somehow. I’m serious. Sorry, I wasn’t laughing to dismiss that. Yes, that’s a viewpoint that I am committed to also, but I don’t always feel So
12673	I don’t really like the alternative either. How do you think there are no good options? Yeah. The only thing in particular that I can Yeah. But have you been thinking of doing it yourself? Mostly
12686	These are a lot of really kind of mildly annoying things, usually, really ramped up and in one space. Way too much? Yes, like, way. And I wasn’t really usually I’ll start out at Convention and be like“Aww, guys. You’re all over the top but that’s okay. Teenage girls in Dalek costumes, that’s great!” In what? Um, Dalek costumes from Doctor Who. Daleks are these evil robots. Okay.
12698	that are mixed are going to be a problem, but maybe if I spend a day dying a bunch of yarn and using up all the mixed dyes then I can make that more packable. That sounds like a reasonable thing to think about and maybe setting aside time to do that dying. It is reasonable up until the point that maybe those colors might not all go together and then if I have to mix up other colors, usually I end up with more empty containers than I started with. I guess if I was really purposeful and don't care if I make really ugly color combinations, I could do it. You probably care about that, though.
12703	Okay. A little, actually we started a couple minutes, so it's seven minutes. It's so interesting because in some ways it's sort of making explicit, "Here's what I need to be taken care of. Can you do this thing?" And not only can you do it, but can I take it in then? What is it like when this need gets met? Have you thought of anything?
12738	Like I just want to hide. I think you might worry that I won't react well if you hide for a little while. Yeah. And then I'm going to say something to you that puts some other demand on you or limitation or burden that you can't bear. No, not really. I just don't really have anything to say. I don't worry too much about you. Mm hm. I don't know.
12765	Yes. It was actually last winter. It was why I fired my previous therapist. There was another time since we had been meeting where you'd opened a cabinet. Was it before we met? Yeah. I probably told you all about it. Right. I'm confused because I thought you had fired her because of how she was about some of the stuff you were talking about.
12781	Okay. So to me they seem like different processes but Okay. I don't know maybe that doesn't feel right. Maybe they. You know, I do a lot of research and so the process of search and the process of
12786	Yeah, so when asking questions and thinking about it, I had a desire to tell you that I feel sorry for dismissing that experience and also to tell you that I was sorry for your loss if that were the case.
12806	Manchester Hospital. Mental. You could pretty much just walk in. I mean, I don’t necessarily mean walk in and get an immediate appointment, but walk in and get treatment. Sometimes pretty good treatment. Often by trainees, which is what he’d be getting, I guess, where you found. But as you say, they’re either and hopefully well-supervised. And sometimes, the people supervising and running those clinics are really very good. Sometimes not, but I guess that just expands or elaborates your thought with it, along similar lines.
12812	So that was Monday. So you didn't find out that she wasn't taking it Until she I found out she wasn't getting any. So it wasn't I did not need to do anything to get her to get it. It just was a 'why on earth have you not been doing this?' And I understand how one fails to do errands like sometimes you get busy, sometimes you don't feel like doing whatever particular errand I get that, but this is not an errand of the same magnitude as getting butter or something.
12826	And then in to the actual process of sending applications. I think I mentioned that in chemistry, almost all the post doc, positions, want to just send applications to people. So you noted that I like to construct rules to govern my environment or something. That particular feature is a strength in some areas
12835	it made me think that I didn’t really like that question. And my not liking…but the reason that I began to be more focused on you is that my liking or not liking a question should not be the reason that I respond to it. So it wasn’t that I was…I mean maybe it seemed like I was becoming defensive. I didn’t feel like, you know, defensive per se.
12874	You'd have to look it up. They usually post that information somewhere on the website so you can check that out. Get a sense. I'm not saying count your calories because I would prefer that you be going by whether you feel full and do you feel like you're getting a good variety. Sometimes it is informative to get a sense of how many calories is a donut? How many calories is a coffee drink? Sometimes you might be way off base from what you're guessing.
12876	But it's not working because I have tried...we have basically two rooms, we have the bedroom, we have the living room/dining room, we have an open kitchen and the bathroom and the patio. So what do you want to happen then? What are you hoping someone will tell you to do? I'm hoping that someone will...I don't know. All I know is I really need more help because it's really exhausting and really like... What is more help look like? What kind of help do you need?
12902	And more, it sounds gut wrenching. You know, I mean, And there’s something very parallel that seems like also characteristic of the way that this is disturbing. How old is Yvonne’s kid? Like five or something? Five, or six or something like that; yeah. I mean to see a kid that age, and sort of that vulnerable and out of control. Yep.
12954	Listen, or listen and believe? Both listen and believe what they say and if they say something that sounds, like if they're a very highly intelligent person, even when they're not highly intelligent, if they say it with conviction it's like I sometimes tend to just feel like it's the word of God. Like if you are saying this then it must be the case.
12959	That’s exactly it, and what’s released to allow you to do the fight or flight response is the adrenaline, - Right, so when your body needs you to get ready to do something, it surges out a load of adrenaline, and the adrenaline basically gets you ready for action, right, so it does things like it gets your heart rate up, it gets your breathing speed up, so that you’re ready to run, it can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry, it can sometimes make people feel a bit lightheaded. Are those the kind of symptoms that you can get?
12965	and that you're going to not want me to come back, and that you're going to be finished with this because you thought I was being irresponsible that I wasn't here as I should be more responsible, because I because I arranged to do the session with you. Mm-hmm. So, first of all, were you aware that all of those assumptions are selfcreated, by you, because...
12967	Yeah. What I might have caught as well, probably not, but I think I get what you mean, that like, there’s a lot going on there that’s reflective of her point of view. Yeah, and also since I’m already familiar with the subject, basically ... it’s quite possible that if I was less familiar with it, although a coworker of mine did comment on the bus to Roxbury thing, without any prompting, so. Yeah, the more I think about it, that’s really...
12974	I don't know. My mom will deny this now, I think, but Jamie remembers. We were laughing about this the other day. I just have a slower metabolism than he does, and I feel like as a girl growing up, I was just a little bit you know, I had more weight on me. So I started sneaking things, yeah. Do you think your parents knew? I don't know. So where would you get the food?
12981	I mean, I'm sure when Lucille is around he acts differently. Clearly whatever she has, he wants. Whatever he has, she wants. He's fighting for my attention when she's playing with me. Yeah. When I have him over, he's downstairs playing with and wants to watch America's Funniest Home Videos. Yeah.
12989	Then I have no marriage left, I have no...Ivan is, things are going to get worse for him. I actually think you'd have more likely to have a marriage that would get saved if you could say "It's not my problem," more. Because he will also have more likely of a marriage he's going to save the more he can say "It's my problem, I got to do this, I got to own this."
13044	c) in e-mail at least there's a record of what is said; d) dad has a hard time understanding me because I don't know he says my English isn't clear enough for him, that I talk too fast and use too many big words, even though I make every effort when I'm talking to him to speak slowly and clearly. I don't find you particularly difficult to understand.
13061	A, that's not what they were doing, because it's not like they're normally dealing with their issues, so it's not like leaving them behind is a change. And B, David's approach to the weekend was to try to mend fences with all of his siblings who are not... someone's always fighting among his siblings. There are, like, six of them, so to... so it's...
13066	I don’t feel like I know if I was feeling more irritated just from jump because I’ve been feeling more depressed, or if I’m feeling more irritated because of medication, or if I was feeling more irritated because I’m obsessed with or concerned about feeling more irritated. I mean, from where I sit, on my hunch it might be the medication. Because it seems to me there are other times you’ve been really pretty low.
13075	that's how avoidant he is. That's how much he sticks his own head in the sand, you know? That's extraordinary, tells you not to confront him about it and this is how much things got pushed under the rug in this family and still to this day he can't be a responsible, appropriate parent around. An appropriate parent would have been to call him and say "I need to let you know I know this, I'm so concerned about you, what can we as parents do to help you with this?
13089	In that same situation Tanya would not say anything until it was like until she was already overwhelmed by whatever negative feelings there were. That’s not helpful to anyone. Not that it’s not accepted to be overwhelmed by feelings but that like… It seems like you’re really important observation is interesting. So I think that’s a large part of what I mean about like intense moments of danger,
13110	Shawarma sandwiches and French fries, and just sit down and go to town. When I was younger, maybe it was or I would just have extra meals, I feel like. I remember these girls, these good friends who I played softball with, who were twins, and they were really overweight too, and we kind of like, we'd just like go to this 24-hour deli. We'd go in there, you know, like after we'd already had dinner.
13137	And then also the whole getting out of the house and having something to do. So there's a lot that would change if this works out. Was there anything you could write a cover letter for this week? I mean there was the thing last week. I haven't really tried this week because I've been, well there was the whole going back and forth with the temp agency and then the whole panic thing, so. So that got in the way even of being able to -
13138	been that long since they've been here? Maybe I'm misestimating. So I guess Amanda was here in February, so that's been about six months. David was here maybe in March. So... maybe April. One of those two. So four to six months, yes. So it's been that long since they've been here. They've been in touch with Tanya and talking with her, which is good, but essentially not communicating with me at all, which
13143	And, yet, it was easier, in a way, because I could be proud of his, you know, great education, of his incredible work ethic. The fact that he owned and ran his own business completely by himself. Yeah. The fact that he was coming home, you know, at an ungodly hour but he just delivered a, you know, new something or other. He just saved some animal's life. He just did some crazy four hour surgery. Hm.
13144	no regard for there is a past or if there well, regard for the past, definitely, but no regard for the future. But I think my thinking is opening in that direction a little bit. And I actually do feel like or a sense that oh, I guess I'm sad right now and it feels awful. But maybe I won't feel so awful in a few hours or in a few days. I don't know. That's quite a change. Is it?
13156	People do a lot of re-interpretations which is usually fun, but... I sort of never had that, “Oh everyone’s really jammed in and kind of crazy and annoying, but I still love you” moment.
13158	When I think that way... And so when you take the pressure off yourself, do you feel differently? Oh, my God! I feel completely different. So is this something you'd be willing to... Yes! ...Keep doing? Yes, absolutely. And do you see how empowering this is? It is. It is. Because it is you being the master, or mistress, whichever you prefer, of your own emotional destiny. Yes.
13178	He does get along . . . I don't know. Probably also in the summer, because the kitchen is hot, the living room at least has the fan. I don't know. I guess he's less comfortable eating in the kitchen, so if people aren't in the living room, then it's fine; but if they are in the living room, then it's a problem and then if he's also too sick to go out or something, then we just have to wait. One day I made the compromise of eating in the room, but I really don't like doing that. He thinks I'm kind of crazy for not eating in my bedroom and I spent my whole life pretty much
13198	Like you need to get a regular sleep schedule if you're going to try to get out of depression and... But like, you know, so there's sometimes he thinks they're right and sometimes he doesn't think they're right. And... Whereas I usually think I'm right. Because it's not an isolated incident. It's a chronic feeling of not mattering sometimes and... Yeah. That's a really tough pattern that you guys are stuck in because you can't change his behavior. Yeah.
13221	I don’t think so; I think really more of what something is there like he was conveying a lot of like sort of theories about it, and I feel like I mean, one of the problems that I run into with James, is that like I’ll tell him about something that
13240	I'll have a drink tonight, you know? Or, I'll let myself go get a fancy sandwich or something, you know, like I don't know. So it was always, I still kind of had them separated. In retrospect, I think my exercise and eating habits maybe, were more out of control than my cocaine habit, because they kept spiraling further and further. They were constantly...
13251	Now he’s like, not giving her the password to their joint account; like he changed the password; won’t give it to her; drained it; put most of the funds in a private account for him. And like, he’s been a total asshole, and she was trying to negotiate with him and his lawyer on her own, and like she has screwed herself over financially, and even though she has legal counsel, I’m like she’s not going to get as much financially as she could have. yeah
13289	people that will use that according to their own agendas in ways that are very hurtful. And the other is that that becomes your agenda which really hurts somebody else. Yeah. So if this awful, why would I want to share that with anybody? But I think I mean it doesn’t seem like
13295	and horriblized, and it was lucky when you called that I was available for that time for us to talk ... I'm very lucky.
13310	To me it seems like you don’t need as much help bearing those things or maybe any – by contrast. I guess I can also see in a way how you are feeling like being well, if I’m thinking about how to tell people about this, it’s because I want to spread it out into the world or put these bad things out there into the world. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. More something like you’re looking for some help with how bad you feel.
13316	That's not, that's not... The question isn't, "Can you get me a job?" The conversation is, "Hey. I... Remember me? We worked together at blah, blah, blah," if that's how far back you need to go or, "Stopped in. Just wanted to let you know I've been looking for a position in this field. Thought I'd let you know in case you knew of anything."
13320	Yeah, I know the diagnostic criteria. I'm a little skeptical of some of the sorts of questionnaires for this kind of thing, but whatever. The bottom line is you try the medication and if it helps, that's great. If it doesn't help, then stop. Well, I told Jess and she was like "Well, I suspected it."
13342	I feel like that's the kind of thing that, with taxes and social security, if you do they'd be able to find it out. Now I'm just sort of like I think I can do my current job with the depressed amount I feel, as long as I can get myself in the car and drive to work and drive back. If I start working slowly it means that I'll be working at probably the level they had expected me to work at in the first place, so that's okay. I'm not sure about applying to other . . .
13343	I also found out that it turns out that October-ish one of the generic producers of Wellbutrin produced some bad batches. That was right around the time that I was having trouble with the Wellbutrin. I don't think if it's enough to know whether that would be worth it to go back on Wellbutrin, especially because the Desipramine works with panic stuff and the Wellbutrin doesn't.
13370	I'm kind of trying to talk about anxiety and I feel like I've been trying to act like it's not as much of a big deal as it is, but it's just really devastating for me. I feel like it's crippling me. Uh huh. I'm so scared. Uh huh. I don't even know what I'm scared of, I'm just so scared. Yeah. I think some of what you're scared of
13381	that’s about how I interpret the world... but I also feel like, one of the things that you... sometimes suggest is that I interpret the world... for lack of a better word, incorrectly like, I have not ruined this conversation in any real sense. I’ve perturbed it, in the sense of... every time one of us speaks, the conversation is altered, but that’s the meaning of conversation, so...
13442	And not about, "I really want to talk about this." Sort of like almostAnd I understand there's-they're not completely untied. But it's not about you and what you want and what you need in your session and what you're going to talk about today. Yeah, that's interesting. It's like you being here for me, rather than me being here for you. Um... I certainly don't think of the session that way, so.
13448	No, it really didn’t. I mean he was like oh we can take –because we still have some boxes like my parents came up over the weekend and helped, but I still have some boxes and don’t really have a place to put them. So it would have been too hard to move everything out in time. So if you got creative, what could be a choice that you could make? That doesn’t feel like a choice, having people over. But is there something else you could do? Maybe to celebrate belatedly on another day? Probably yes.
13485	don't have time for this type of thing". That was her attitude when I am good, she is nice, and when she disapproves ... I think I see that in me now but it's like I have to put on this sort of facade that everything's great because that's the only way I think I'm going to get... Rewarded? Rewarded, yeah. Well, now at your age? Yeah.
13493	were going to be denied services, because they’re not really sick. And she has to restart the whole evaluation and diagnostic process over with a new therapist. I was like – She’s got a lot of horrible circumstances going on, But like she spent an hour literally telling me about she's an academic failure, which she's got 10 years. She’s deeply depressed, like borderline suicidally depressed, and I don’t really know what I can do to help her, other than encourage her to go find a therapist of her own,
13495	He's going to get more depressed. I don't think anyone...I can't talk about anything that's going on that's wrong with his behavior or anything that hurts me because it sends him further into shame and guilt and depression. I'm not talking about wrong with his behavior, do you hear the words that I'm saying are "I'm terrified." He'll feel horrible about that. That's his problem. No it really does become my problem because I need to take care of him when he is writing notes and making threats and sobbing through church because we're going to get a divorce.
13513	I think you were incredibly deprived as a child of what you needed. But I think adults need that too and that's actually what you hope to find in friends, in partners, still in one's mother and father. Right? Even as an adult. You've asked a number of times, "What does that actually look like." Lacking of all models, for example, about what does it look like when a healthy married couple is doing it well? Mm hm. And I think
13586	And at the office, if I don't put things in the spot that they're supposed to be, I can't find them. So I used to get pissed off at Jess because she would lose her keys and I would always be like "Well, I never lose my keys. I never lose my wallet. I know exactly where they are. I come home and put them in the same exact spot every time," you know.
13589	Yeah, especially since I found a place so I'm not even worrying about that. There's a little bit of move-date parts that are stressing me because I've tried two companies and one was going to be for September 1st like $248 an hour with a six hour minimum, which was going to be over $1,000. I'm pretty sure my move can be done in three to four hours. The company that I did end up going with,
13610	But, yeah. If you called outpatient psychiatry at a hospital in the area, they could probably just tell you what’s offered there, as well as where else you could go. Because that’s probably a referral they have to make a lot. Right. Yeah, I don’t know anybody who practices out there who I know firsthand. But if you get stuck, let me know. I can probably find somebody who does. Okay
13707	Send the least scary e-mail and, and it doesn't... You don't need to beg for a job. You want to start at the reintroduction. Think about it as a reconnecting and just letting people know you're out there. You're out there looking. You're not asking them to do a specific thing for you. You're not expecting a particular response.
13741	How did you manage to do that? How did you focus your thoughts enough to be able to make good decisions and drive safely? I don't know. I guess I was sort of focusing on the road but like you know there was still that underlying uncomfortable feeling inside me that was anxiety and like it was very much still there and I was aware and like, 'okay, I'm driving this car while I'm panicking.' So I don't know how I did it, I just did things because I had to. I think that's usually the way that things happen to me so that if I can get anything productive done it's like because it has to be done.
13755	and I'm kind of wondering if we really should because this week he hasn't been walking around staring at this heart looking depressed, but I'm not sure why actually. But he gets into a period of doing that. Well, meditation certainly wouldn't hurt. You know when we do the breathing exercises and the mindfulness that's a type of meditation, the same
13769	I mean... In some ways, I guess I have felt like that. Maybe if I go to parties with him hosted by his friends or his faculty and just watching and waiting for a cue from him where yea. Or in India is when he was doing his research, I was just following him. And being with him made it easier or navigating a foreign city. He would know how to navigate the city. Take an ottoman stuff.
13781	And you don't need to weigh yourself very often. You could weigh yourself once a month, just being aware of the choices that you're making. You have your goal of one yarn box . . . For Friday. For Friday. We're not meeting next Monday, I think. It's the 1st. I have us not meeting that week and then meeting the week after, which is the 8th, at 2:30. Okay. Okay. So we'll set another goal that day. Okay.
13792	Jesse You can continue to practice the attitude that your mother modeled for you or you can stop that crap. Your choice. Since you see clearly now that your mother's behavior was not healthy.
13809	Like, you’re not staring at me like, “Okay, what are you going to say now? It’s your turn to talk.” Whereas... in some ways that’s the gaze Gerard has. I don’t think he... I think he both realizes it and does not realize it. It’s the gaze he has after he’s asked if there are questions in the class
13810	it's just that pediatricians do 900 different things, you know, 50 of which are mental health. I guess that's why I am I'm saying. Well, I imagine it's not a regular pediatrician who is in there for cold and flu and swallowing magnets. Right. I don't know who referred. It might have been her own therapist or whatever. Yeah, you know —
13822	Because when I do feel the depression it's not usually from thinking about any of those stressors, it's just from nowhere. Nothing that I can think of is actually triggering it. Maybe there are times where I got more upset, like when I got upset with Sydney on Wednesday night about the "now you tell me that your housemates don't want me around as much instead of listening to me months ago;"
13835	he's really driven, successful, smart. Right. Yeah. And he, compared to most of my friend's parents, nobody's parent worked longer hours, nobody had more education that my Dad. Nobody. I felt proud of that. I do think that's okay. I think that's a healthy thing to feel proud about. I guess the other part that made it feel okay was the thought in my mind
13850	I don't know. They pushed the pacemaker before. They didn't bring it up yesterday. Maybe he just didn't want to go there. I don't know. Josh talked to him about stem cell trials and I thought he was kind of out there but the doctor was like, ‘sure.' I don't know, I mean it won't kill him yet, right now. He's still healthy and strong enough that it won't kill him unless he has an extreme stroke or something. Is that more likely? Is that the risk factor for him?
13855	You sounded worst to me actually than last week. Yeah. At first, when you said about feeling freer less dependent, like putting stuff out there, I wasn’t sure good thing coming from it we talked about last time; it doesn’t seem that way. As we talked more, it seems more like you don’t care - I don’t care. In the way that
13985	Well, I wonder... were you going to say something? I'm very curious about what you wonder. I was just going to say it's also... I mean, I can't really even talk about it with her because she doesn't remember it. So it's like, how can I hold her accountable for something she...? I'm in a position of power in a sense, of I can say, this happened, or, you were this way. And how can she rebut or comment? So it's like I can't even, I don't know, address it or something.
13993	You're booking this trip. The schedule is determined by the flight from L.A. I was like, "Okay, fine. We'll book the fucking flight from Boston to L.A. Give me the contact info for the travel agent." He didn't send it. There were three e-mails in a row from me to dad saying, "Give me the info for the travel agent so I can book us from Boston to L.A." Finally he said it's such-and-such travel agency.
13999	Not well, like physically, that I'm not feeling good. It is not that it is OK... OK, it is not OK. ...But it is not desirable, but it is the way it is. And you're taking medication. It is the way it is, right. Aren't you? Yes. And...?
14007	And Franco's friends. And it went really well and I felt better while we were there. But I really didn't want to go. Uh huh. Yeah. Yeah, I really do want to hear the reasons because that wasn't really a rhetorical question, and I feel like I want to know. And in other ways I feel like they're not going to give any reasons that are good enough. Mm hm
14028	No. So what she does for you there sounds like part of a healthy even sisterhood that that could exist in a way that's not a problem at all. It's healthier if you're doing that for her sometimes too, if it's reciprocated. And it sounds like she has a hard time taking that in. Mm hm. Mm hm. She does not, no. So that might be the growing edge of your relationship with her
14031	Right. So then you have to sort of wonder if I weren't there what would happen. Something would happen. I presume these organizations would not fall apart entirely. If I hadn't been here, what would have happened? I think Tanya's family would have come up and handled that or she would have killed herself. But then we're getting into if I weren't here this whole situation would be radically different anyway.
14043	I think you can relate to that, just, it’s not as sort of, you don’t hold yourself to the kind of rigidity she does. Are you confused by my comment on it? No, no. Meta-confused. We’re doing something different today than we usually do. I’m pleased by it, though, so... Oh. Well, how do you mean. What are we doing differently?
14061	you actually are decreasing your chances of getting a job. It's just a low hit rate. Right? Like imagine the pigeon hitting the And every three hundred times, one in three hundred, it's going to go off and you'll get the food pellet. So if it stops pecking it's definitely not going to get the food pellet. But it's very, very, very, very infrequent reinforcement. And I think that's part of what's happening. You're used to doing something and something happens.
14076	the treatment implications are pretty straightforward and there's not a big cost in any way associated with them, so you may as well try. Well, she thinks that Ian has ADHD and she's meeting with whoever it is tomorrow. Whoever it is, like a mental health provider? Yeah. Okay, as opposed to — I forgot the name or title — something. I've got it here in a text. Developmental pediatrician.
14091	And you don't think that way." It's like, well, I wish I could be just a little bit like that. Will I always be insecure? Or will I be able to feel a little secure in myself? You're not sure. Huh? You're not sure. No. Right now, I'm not. Because you're feeling especially insecure?
14137	and bad about not having done it and I feel angry and that's not a useful kind of combination of emotions for us to have a conversation. And so if I were to wait for a little while before bringing it up again, I can be less angry and she can be less guilty and maybe we can actually have a conversation in which the like factual piece that she has to do this in a more timely fashion can be discussed.
14171	She lost her mother. She hated her father because he was cheating on her mother and she blamed him for her mother's death. She had a brother who died. She had a brother who was mentally retarded. He was bitter and jealous of her and now doesn't talk to her. She, she knows all the right, I mean she, intellectually,
14181	Well, we walked in simultaneously. Timed well ... So if the bus was late... Could you control that ... And I said oh, don't even do that. All right. Just get to the "shoulds." OK. "Even if I'm late, which I wasn't terribly, then..." Even... "Does that make you a terrible person?"
14224	Hello Jessa. Hi. I want to hear whatever you're wanting to tell me and also I'd like to know about the homework but before that, a few days ago we had a quickie emergency session didn't we? Yes we did. It lasted about thirty minutes or so. I was not able to record it at the time. Would you mind sharing what happened, how you felt, what we did, what you did and what happened afterward? Sure.
14229	You know I actually think that you being pregnant is a good thing. I’m very happy for you and hopeful that things will be good for you and. It sounds like it’s given us an opportunity to talk about these things. So thank you for that particular way of phrasing it. But I don’t think so. I actually…thank you for indulging me talking about these things while you’re pregnant. Indulging sounds so trivial, for a lack of a better term. I’m not doing it to indulge you.
14255	for doing the car, doing a good job, and somehow that would be normal? I don't know. Is there something else? I'm not sure. Just kind of something beyond my comfort zone, you know. I don't have really good woodworking or painting or any time of skill that requires making something using a tool. I guess I sort of think that's the same thing again. I hear what you're saying. you're not sort of, like,
14273	and that there should be one answer and that one person is right and that they have all the answers, and I know deep down that that's not it but when I get into certain situations that tend to come up for me where I feel dependent upon what somebody says or doesn't say, so it's like taking
14289	Some things I end up in charge of because I want to be, speaking much more generally than like this specific illness. There's a graduate student advisory council in Ohio in the department of Biomechanics that I ended up being co-chair of. I didn't want to be on the committee. I was elected while actively campaigning against myself.
14320	Well, it is not less difficult right now. Can you accept that? No. Yes. If "No" then stay frustrated ! All right. My mind goes to this other place when the disputing comes. To which other place? Oh, I know "Jessa, you can't dispute it because it is too hard for you, and you should be better at it." Hello.
14436	Yeah. So you sound like you're at your whit's end Ramona. If your saying you can't not let some of these things go for a month, do you know what I mean? That this is that important? For example, what if you were to separate? I don't mean divorce, I don't mean we're in a separation I just mean living...you went and lived with your sister for a month or something like that or he went and got his own apartment for a month?
14443	The words are horse, basketball and car. Do you often feel suicidal and can you recall what exactly triggered the attempt last night? I’m not suicidal. Sometimes I cut myself to feel the pain and release it. In the past I cut too deep, but got stitched up. Would you be willing to see the therapist again and try the Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and a new medication? This is the help I can offer you today.
14445	Hi, I’m one of the psychiatrists who work here in the Department of Psychological Medicine and you are? Elizabeth, but everyone calls me Liz. I have spoken with your physician, Dr. Green, and have read his reports and know some of the things about why you are here today. However, I would like to hear from you why you have come to see me today.
14516	that would be one thing. Or the kid was incredibly anxious, and just comes out of the bed every ten minutes, because they’re, you know, afraid of a ghost or something, and they sort of are gentle, but firm, that’s different. This is not that. Yeah. I mean it didn’t sound like they had anything. No. And that – yeah.
14557	Right. That's the adaptive part for you. The down side is that your feeling those things could draw you closer to him. I know. I understand. That's why I'm here. I guess. Well, maybe I say that because that should be a question. Maybe you're afraid those feelings will actually push you away. At least the anger part. What do you mean?
14564	I felt just like I was doing something that I wasn't supposed to. Or I was doing something that people I don't know might find weird if they knew about it. Or not like it or something like that. But yea, it was freeing. I don't exactly know what it feels like to feel free. There's a lot of anxiety attached to freedom, I think, for me. So because I'm doing something it feels like I'm doing it for the first time. Or I don't know what it's going to be. Yea, what is free what is it what do you mean when you say, "feel free?" I don't know.
14572	From over here you balked at it. I’m sensitive to particular things. So, I asked if this was your first pregnancy and you sort of…that was the moment at which you disengaged from directly asking questions and started, I felt like, harvesting more defensively. You were more reluctant to answer some questions. That is one that I believe that
14604	We're you panicking while you were doing that? Or did the panic sort of subside a bit while you were active? I was panicking while I was doing it, you know, and still panicking when I was at the theater and like adding photos above the yarn things to put up on my store and panicking, you know - when I was sending e-mails and stuff and I guess I didn't do that much, I did some productive things. I guess I went grocery shopping but that was before the panic had started. And, oh, we went to the store and I was still panicking then and we drove home.
14616	...Is the depression. OK. So what I've reminded you is, when you recognize an unhealthy emotion, the mantra or the question to ask yourself is, "What am I telling myself to create this?" Got you.
14639	The words you said don't create depression which usually comes from adding should or musts, for example "and I shouldn't be that way" .... Umm... I think...Everybody else is fine and I'm not. That doesn't create depression. I'm lost. I don't know... because that is really what I think.
14640	Yeah, so that's not actually as bad, but if I'm doing more specialized things where I need certain colors and I'm thinking about doing that before I move . . . I guess if I'm doing it soon enough . . . I don't know. I guess the worst-case scenario is only a quarter teaspoon of dye that I'm using in each color thing, so if I had to put out 15 bins of different colors and rinse them out it wouldn't be that big of a loss.
14649	Yeah, so we were visiting our friends last week and you know, occasionally like the question of, 'what do you want to do?' and I found it nearly impossible to answer that question. I always find that something of a difficult question because I feel like my needs need to be balanced against some sense of group needs which I think comes from having four siblings and having a strong recognition that we all have desires like from an early age. But usually I find the problem, like where's the balance or something like that.
14652	That’s why I don’t feel good that I’m not allowed to be angry about that. Like, that sucks. So that’s what I’m learning. Yeah. And so when I take James’ mom out, she’ll have very much and hold very much; our
14689	And I don't feel good about that. I feel like that makes me this horrible, snobby, demanding, critical - Hm. Because I guess when, I feel like when you marry someone it shouldn't be, "I'm marrying you because I know you are a lawyer or a doctor." Or, you know, like, "And you will always earn a good living and have a, you know, fulfilling career that will last you until retirement, that you feel satisfied with, that earns good money, that is secure, that you're passionate about. Mm hm.
14722	and let’s go out for dinner. But, you know, then she’s like, “Well, you know, Madison only sees me part of the time, and I don’t really want the babysitter, and Christopher might use that against me in the divorce proceedings.” She’s worried that Christopher is going to try to get full custody of Madison with only supervised visits for her. Frankly, I kind of see her point, and if I were Christopher, I sure as hell would want full custody
14737	Yeah. But I think that like I’m sort of trying to revise, because I think that that’s like what I’m upset about, but it’s clearly not why I’m upset, if that makes sense. Like I – I think you’re right that it’s some sort of
14751	Well, and you see that perfectionism in Tanya, although it typically manifests more in relation to herself. I mean, she feels it most acutely, and then most dramatically when she feels she’s falling short of being perfect. But the issue of perfectionism is definitely like,
14762	Or I feel like if I tell her then she will have to deal with this, too, and I just don't want that. I think that's it. I guess part of me is like I'd rather be alone in this than having other people hurting like this; but I also sort of want other people to be there with me, so clearly part of me wants other people to feel like this and I feel bad about that. Somehow it doesn't occur to me.
14793	of the thought is that which I shouldn't be, which I must do. That is it is the clincher thought, like it is it is the one that ties it all up in a neat... Creates the depression, anxiety, and the... Yes. So dispute. OK. Let me see. ...Should have called me. I should have called you. And not doing that...
14806	She made him do this like 10 week counseling program to try to repair their relationship anyway. And I tried telling her like, “This is not fair to him. Even if he’s wrong about calling you abusive, and I think he is, and even if he’s being a kind of a dick about this, if he wants to be out of the relationship, he gets to be out, and he doesn’t owe you an explanation.” I’m like, “It would be nice if he did out of respect for like the ten years you were together, but you know, he
14842	Taking her, the leaving. It was sad. Yeah, it was just a terrible day and then at night Josh had a talk with his mom and it was a really painful conversation to listen to. I'm not sure He didn't even talk to me about it. He was like, ‘I'm going to go talk to her right now.' Do you know what he which things he addressed with her?
14855	You know, there could be any number of reasons. I don't think it's that he's not around you enough not to know your buttons. He would learn those pretty fast. When he does come over he does spend a lot of time downstairs running around, so he gets a lot of his energy out. They're so loud. I don't know. I'm very much speculating here, but it sounds like Jess is sort of on him a fair amount and worries about him a lot; and he could be kind of pushing back.
14880	Yeah, I understand that. I certainly don't experience the totality of our sessions like that. But there's something in you that feels that way, and I imagine it's related to Tanya, I imagine it's related to a lot of things. Yeah, I mean, I don't know whether it's related to Tanya, or whether they're like both related to the same thing. I think it's more like that. Right, right. Yeah, right. I meant it that way.
14885	It depends what I'm using it for, then again, if it's ugly there are some people who like really weird color combinations that I don't like, so as long as someone can use it. As long as it appeals to someone in your audience.
14897	It might make you feel less anxious because it sounds like a lot of times the anxiety is stemming from not knowing if he's going to be able to follow through on a plan and feeling dependent upon him. Even though you don't need to be dependent upon him for that, it kind of sounds like you kind of feel like you are. Not for that, though right now I'm also looking at making socks for him. There is a skank of two colors
14915	So he ended up taking more like four AM or whatever instead of two AM or something and like it was at least a two hour time difference if not longer. I think it was even one AM that he could have taken it but like, you know, he's acknowledged that he's like, you know he's told me before that he wouldn't do it again and he does it again. It's just like so frustrating. I'm like, "Why do you keep on doing this?" Because he's like, you know, being so immature. Like he doesn't want to face the day or whatever. He wants some alone time right now at like really late
14923	I wouldn't say he's happy but he's not miserable. He's kind of acting happy. Poor guy. I asked him why he was so happy. You did? Yeah. And he said ‘I don't know,' because I think he's got more perspective. I don't know he just seems happier. So what happened in the appointment? What did you hear and learn?
14944	Write a cover letter. Yeah, I mean I used to have like you know, I get out of here and my thing is at 12.30 and it'll take like maybe 20 minutes to get down to the downtown crossing so I could theoretically like look and see if there was one thing to write a cover letter for but the deadline would have been for This is true. But, since I have you here today I thought I'd ask. So I have not actually been looking for things, yeah, but I could in theory write one cover letter, maybe, if there's something there's probably something.
14946	direct answer is, I see what happens. Not just like, what happens between us, I see what happens in me, where my mind goes, what I’m feeling and then try,
14949	Guardianship? Stewardship. Maybe. I don't know. I think that's a thing to grow, to regain. And I really, I think that doing that in a normative, higher emotion is a way to work towards regaining that mode of interaction. Yeah, my thought on that obviously, whatever you want to do, you do. The issue at hand is you've felt for so long that you've had to bracket your needs for the sake of Tanya and in a sense felt a conflict that your needs, if they don't, maybe not to say, undermine her needs,
14965	can't take anything, so I'm just not because I'm focused on that right now. I'm focused on just like trying to get through having really bad cramps and not being able to take any pain killers for it, that maybe I'm not so I'm like... It's weird, but it's kind of nice to be having a health situation that I'm familiar with.
14990	Merry Christmas. Oh, thank you very much, same to you. Take care. You too. Bye. Bye.
15000	what we did. We went and had dinner and went to one of their apartments, and I gave them the drugs, and that was in that moment, I was like, I'm never doing this stuff again. I tried to do it once more when I went to Geneva, a couple weeks later, for my semester abroad, and while I was in
15014	But know that they're just assets and, essentially, with or without them, you're acceptable. If you make mistakes, the mistakes may not be permanent you can work on changing them, but you are a person of worth bottom line, full stop. That would be a good, healthy view to work on having more of, more of the time. Thank you, Debbie. Yes, Jessa. Very helpful. Homework
15019	She got in on Wednesday and then left Friday evening, so it’s kind of a strange time period but, she was on spring break from the teaching job that she works at. So I think that the most salient piece of that is that like I think there’s two pieces of it that in terms of preparing for Candice to visit, you know, cleaning the apartment, converting the room that we have a table in to a room
15032	Like Lucille when she starts soccer she'll be much better than when Ian started soccer because she's already been kicking around a ball. Lucille's another year and a half. it'll be two and a half years before she can play. Instead of being cranky sitting in her little stroller, at some point she'll become more wanting to play and run around.
15068	or do things that would make our life easier, but, you know, he's like going to the doctor's all the time and not feeling well. All winter he basically has been, said he's sick. Sorry. He did go to the new psychologist and he did change his medication for depression that he takes. He was talking Wellbutrin and something else.
15070	So I'm taking 100 at night and 25 in the morning. I think she's trying to get me on that and the Prozac and that's it; maybe the Klonopin. I don't know. As needed, which is all the time. I don't seem anxious when I go to bed because I fall asleep on the couch and I wake up all discombobulated. Good. Hunh. I mean not the discombobulated part, but... But not being anxious. Yeah.
15092	Yeah. And I guess... My dad sent to me the e-mail. It was like, "Oh, give your resume to this person. Her husband might have, might know things about a job." You know, thinking about my dad I was like, "What the hell?" Like... But I didn't say anything. All I did was wrote the person sent her my resume and told her like, "I'm his daughter. Blah, blah, blah..." And she said she would send it to her husband. I don't really know what kind of job. Like a lead on a job.
15109	Like I said, it was very well framed and I'm just, yeah, those are the I don't know, points in the distance in some sense. So then I think something like that and how it's helpful and freeing and then I think about the question or the it will occur to me that that was the right thing to say, if such a thing exists.
15115	Is there something, a change within your life, or a trigger that occurred that you recall before the symptoms began? Are you having any distressing memories that keep coming back or maybe a situation where you feel scared or really want to avoid? Well I have just moved back to town this last year with me two young daughters. I am living in my grandparents’ house - they have both passed.
15124	His vitamin D suggestion is something that he pulled off the fucking Internet. It's not something that came from a doctor and the number of bullshit snake oil, fix-your-life remedies that Dave has tried because some of the quantified self people did it on themselves are you familiar with this phenomenon the quantified self?
15132	That's what happened when you were 20. If horrible, horrible things happen, your whole system starts responding as though you're there for survival and waiting for the next blow. It's not about, then, forward thinking and productivity and planning and being a pro-active person. Reactivity is what's important when you're in trauma for safety, so I could see also this feeling as you look down on yourself that you're not
15141	this week yes, but not usually, no. Right. Yeah, not usually. It's not I mean that one experience with coke, I'm not surprised that it it's like apost-traumatic stress reaction. Yeah. It's like someone goes to war, and you hear shells and then you hear a car alarm go off and you get -
15190	you suggested I have a tendency to despair. This... Go ahead. You agreed like you were going to say something. Well, that abol , that the disappointment slides into that. Yeah, I that’s right. And so, you know, I’ve been working on it. Describing that as a thing that happens is, has been helpful and also you... we spend a lot of time talking about things could be non-ideal
15228	that feels better. And here am I going to hurt you? Are you going to hurt me? As you've gotten close to people you've gotten hurt one way or another in your early life. You know that comedienne, Margaret Cho? Do you know what I'm talking about? She has a think on salon.com
15247	Without insurance to get a, I don’t know, consultation. I don’t know. Just a lot prices are outrageous. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s because he’s in Miami and they have all these fancy, I don’t know, recovery centers or something. I was like, “There’s got to be something else.” I don’t know. Right. A community clinic.
15250	And then I try to think about the other things since that's not going to go anywhere so I want to think about something else. Yeah, I think I'd like uncertainty to be bounded and I think that's more or less the correct bounding on uncertainty. I certainly don't know where we'll end up or where I will end up, but yeah. The space is marked in some way or something.
15288	attack while I was high on cocaine, totally possible, because I can't really separate the two. But it's that same feeling that I get when and it happened a couple nights ago too. It's been hard for me to start eating again, because for a month, every time I ate, I got really sick, because I have an ulcer.
15304	making a ton of money and working all the time, so you never saw him. Yeah. Like, in other words, like your father. Yep. I would certainly imagine that you would have a problem with that too. That's the weird thing because I hated never seeing my Dad. I got to the point where I didn't want to see my Dad because I was so angry at him that I was never going to come first. Yeah.
15313	Michaels. Sure, Michaels. They have a whole pile of derby stuff. Sure. That sounds ideal then. It's mostly about spending time with the kids, doing something together. something fine. What's involved? Did they give you, like, the parts of the cars and you have to put together or... They gave you a block and some wheels.
15356	Your family does not know about this abuse from your cousin? No. No way. I told a counselor once. I can’t tell them because all it would do is cause pain for the family. It’s over and done and I just want to move on with my life. I have just separated from my husband and want to move on with my life. Do you know about family history or any mental illness or other medical issues?
15361	Tell me what's new? I'm feeling pretty proud of myself right now. I woke up this morning and I was really not doing well. I slept two hours later than I meant to because I'd wake up and I'd be like, "I can't get up. I can't do this," and then go back to bed and set my alarm for another half an hour. I'm sure James really likes that.
15406	Carl made the 911 call for the ambulance. According to your file, you attempted suicide before. This was your fifth attempt. I’ve been in to have my arms stitched up and stomach pumped a few times. Nobody cares. I wish someone would help me! Maybe you’re the one. I am here to help you. Can you tell me about your past medical history, your family history? I have four kids. Oh my God! Where’s my baby? Where is she?
15433	after like years of working towards it. But she feels like a failure, because she hasn’t published enough papers, and she had to step down from like some leadership position in her department. And she’s going through another divorce, and her kid is severely autistic. Because her kids’ therapist had been embezzling the insurance for like six years, the government decided that all of his therapist patients
15445	Yeah. Like your mom makes it about her. I have like a tickle. That’s okay. Well they each have sort of agendas that feel very destructive or hurtful to you. Yeah.
15450	So it’s like in the last couple to three weeks even, I’ll be like in this awful place, just totally miserable and desperate and kind of crazy-making and then I go to do something, usually it was something for church, and act like I’m okay and after about a half hour somebody will ask “how are you doing?” and I’ll be like “oh, I’m great.”
15458	But of course it also assumes that work is something that doesn't take, you know, would take enough of my brain, because I was just thinking like if I'm at work like especially now that I like finished the actual project I needed to finish, like if I'm just coming in to like do whatever, like I don't know, like Tara is very talkative so if I end up wasting time and talking to like Tara and stuff
15497	And he woke up in the middle of the night feeling like he'd just been shocked. The second night and that was really scary and didn't call the doctor and I was like, ‘oh my gosh, take less drugs.' So, and again now that I think about it he's been dealing with it fairly well. I just kind of I guess, haven't been too rough on him, been bummed out about it all. I don't know. It sounds like he's got some sort of perspective that you haven't had yet. Maybe it's different to be the patient versus the one watching the patient, your
15498	been getting either one of those. It's not that he's the opposite of your Dad and always there for you, always catering to you. Buying you flowers, figuring out what you need, you know, putting you front and center. And he's not that successful here. So it feels like both realms - Yeah. It does. you're missing out. And I think that's what has been really disappointing.
15516	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yes, I need to think about that a little bit more. I sort of feel like there are broader implications, but I can’t pull them all out right now. And I also feel like it’s a little bit my own thoughts on it are sort of distracting from the main point; if that makes sense.
15545	It can't happen. Why? I don't...Dr. Farrow tried to say something like that, she got creative, I don't know if...I don't mean to say you're not aware but I can't just move in with my sister. She has a one room, like studio type thing on the top floor of a house and they don't turn on their heat and I have a cat and I go to school and she lives in Newton and I have stuff and I would have to be on their lease...
15554	I mean, I talk to—I don’t know. I mean, I don’t think that’s true, but. Well, good. I would rather that not be true. I don’t know. I talk to a few of Stephen’s friends. And two of them are older. One guy I talked to about, I've never even heard of, but he was in his fifties. He was actually with Stephen on Saturday night, that’s how I got his number. It was one of the last ones called. And his friend Harris is older as well in his forties. I don’t know.
15570	And how are you doing today? I’m doing okay. Had a…last Tuesday I had a breakdown at work where I was fine in the morning. I was fine for most of the afternoon. And then towards the end of the last like hour that I was working, I started like shaking. And then I realized that I was panicking. I was able to hide this from everybody, but ended up, you know, leaving an hour early, which, I mean, isn’t that abnormal for me, especially because right now hurts my hands.
15599	Getting specific timeframes where you work on things. And just be thinking of this as this is part of what you're doing in the backdrop. I don't know if it feels like you have to get another job in the meantime. If you knew, for example, right now it's going to take eight months until you find a job. Yeah.
15617	So he's doing some of the things that you expect of him in working through this but not all. Yeah. That's, you know, one of the reasons his sleep bothers you so much is because that feels like something he could be doing to try to get better that he's not... Yeah. ...doing consistently. I mean, I guess more when it impacts my plans for the next day. So it is kind of selfish because if he needs
15620	that even today I'm just. And you don't have to wait for it to be really bad. That's the other thing. That's true. Asking for a hug doesn't have to get to a point where you want to hurt yourself before you ask your boyfriend for a hug.
15628	Well that's been working the past couple weeks so it sounds like sticking with that and not changing that but if you want to add something to it. Now that you've done it successfully a couple weeks in a row... Yeah. ...you could maybe add something to it but I wouldn't take away something that's working. Yeah. But right now I'm like having trouble finding a job for to apply to this week. This week. Well it's Monday.
15653	And then they get to take that where they want. They can say, "Sorry to hear you've been looking for a while. I don't know of anything," or they can say, "Oh, I don't know. But my friend is friends with whoever. I'll drop her an e-mail." That's not a lot of effort for that person to make. Okay. Or, "Oh, I saw in my Twitter feed that such and such is hiring." Yeah. You know, they may not have to do much more than that.
15656	I don't need other people to drag me out of it. Or run. Well, if someone making me go. So you've felt like you could be the one to be responsible for knowing when the limit was, like when it had been enough days of wallowing and now it's time to go out for that run, that would feel okay? Well I used to be able to do that, I used to be much better at pulling myself together. I was in control of everything because I didn't have a boyfriend or dogs or crazy boyfriend's mother, whatever.
15668	That's true. If there's ever a time when you don't feel safe then you call me. If I can't answer then you call the emergency room; but it sounds like it's not him who you tell about those thoughts, especially if you know that they're just thoughts. I know that they're uncomfortable to have, but they don't need any action.
15738	No, no.
15747	It sounds like you need someone in your life understanding what you're going through and how real and how horrible and how scary this is. Just even finding a suicide note Ramona is terribly, terribly scary and overwhelming. I don't know if it felt like that didn't get honored in the couple's session?
15837	So that’s what I mean by it. Not like I didn’t approve of it, but it was yeah; it was something that I was less, sort of just okay, let’s just answer that too. And then when I thought about that, I thought well my liking doing something doesn’t mean that this is necessarily the most productive, or you know, something like that. Liking is a little too strong, but kind of something around that. Okay.
15885	Hi, how are you, today? I figured you were running late. I just had to run for something quick. Sorry about that. Good. It's chilly out. I didn't get a coffee so if I seem slow and unable to think... I have a closing today. Oh, good. Which I've got to squeeze I've just got another day with all kinds of stuff. It kind of stresses me out to have things all lined up throughout the day.
15899	Or just if there is some hiccup somewhere. I'm always wary of hiccups, you know? Like they've got to get a bank check. Are they going to be able to get a bank check? They've got to bring like $6,000 to closing, so is she going to have time to do that? Maybe she will, maybe she won't. I don't know. I'm not taking the risk of a personal check for $6,000.
15938	Yeah. I feel like the extent to which I’ve sort of changed that has been more like remembering that I lose touch than actually not losing touch; and that’s even not that great.
15955	My goodness. She did, she said "Get the fuck away, you’re bonkers." - Did she? Anyway...Ok. ...so she did that and er, so I said yeah, I didn’t think she was clever enough really. - You know not.. and well I went to see the doctor about it. Ok. - Cos I thought I’d show her cos she’s a doctor, you know she’s been to University, she’s done stuff...  -
15979	That's a good question. I think it's just a piece where she feels like if someone else can notice it, she should have noticed it. I think there's a piece where she has had plenty of people tell her, 'oh, you should try this to cure your depression.' You know like, 'when I had a headache, I took some aspirin. If you have a migraine, you should take some aspirin, also.' And that sort of analogy and it doesn't she has a particular ire about that class of discussion. And I
15987	Having it together, having a career and a plan for your life, being motivated and ambitious. But I do also wonder if Ivan continues to make progress with his depression, with his attention disorder, if he continues to, like if he sort of gets to baseline with his job where he gets to the point where he's doing it well and things are going smoothly consistently. And he feels like he could potentially maybe he could reach that too, maybe. Yeah. All of what we're talking about that started with this particular
15994	Where was I going though? I don't remember. I was still in college. I had my car, so it was after this, it was after that experience. Yeah, so I think that was the first time. You told me a little bit about what happened that day, but can you go into a little bit more detail about it? Yeah. Or that actually might have been the second time, depending on if
16033	Would you mind if I ask you to go over again what the problem is, perhaps in your own words so that I get an understanding of it?
16043	Yeah. Even like the isn’t as much a thing anymore. Like I don’t – I ended up hurting myself. Yeah, I don’t know, I – I haven’t been thinking about hating myself as much. And sometimes it’s blank. It’s still there somewhere, but I don’t have to deal with it all the time. I –
16075	that they both feel he's made quite a lot of progress so independently Dr. Board said he's opening up in a way he never did in the beginning, he finds more of his own feelings about actually being angry in the session, being upset rather than just kind of whipping himself shame
16082	If you get a call you won't be able to take it. You can't do it." I think my job for at least the next month is kind of keep my anxiety under control which, you know, that's kind of a full-time job. Too bad I don't get paid for that. Yeah. I feel like I'm getting better at it though.Yeah, this morning sounds pretty different from how it often goes.
16087	It's just I know I'm doing that to myself. And the other night I had this freak out. I thought, "I'm not going to get a job and it's going to be my fault because I stopped doing applications." Mm. "You can't get a job, Ramona, if you don't apply." And so I need a way to keep going. Is it starting to feel kind of like your hopelessness is raising? Mm hm. So it gets harder to then go do
16091	And this idea that you and we went over this before, that you "should be able to do it" by now. Ah... We went over this. It is... I know. It is... It is your tendency to demand perfection from yourself. It is a lot it is exhausting. I'm exhausted.
16094	Well, I guess part of my detachment is if I remove myself from it, I can be happier. You know, I can go out with my friends. I can do things. You know. Maybe, you know, it just sort of came to me. Does the detachment itself cause you distress? Yes. It's the detachment and the sex thing and the more I put an effort in to trying, you know,
16106	It was embarrassing for me. Yeah, at night, and that's and I went right back to that habit in Geneva. Living in a studio apartment by myself was probably the worst thing that could have happened to me at that point, because I would go out and just like, I would go out with a backpack and go get all this food, and come home
16120	Practically speaking I can get ricotta, soft cheeses some of those will actually have a symbol that my house accepts. Those I can get at the regular grocery store, but anything else I need to go to Hamden for. Hamden is the closest place that will have it, which is really frustrating. Yeah, I can understand your frustration; and it's challenging. He was complaining about how his new job was going to have such a long commute. It's all the way out to where you see the sign from the highway and I'm like, "Oh, that's like a third of my commute. I do not feel bad for you at all."
16151	Mm-hmm. Because I'm distracted, I guess. It's something that's familiar to you.Yeah. Because this, you know, it's not like something new and maybe I'm not stressed because I'm not taking any medication. I won't take Tylenol, so maybe I am stressed about it. I'm allowed to take Tylenol but I don't want to take it. I don't know, it makes me nervous, and I think that I'd rather
16159	And the wife is always there. Yeah, but he's still kind of creepy. Yeah. It's a general level of creepiness. It's not like, you know. he's done absolutely nothing to suggest pedophilia or affection for kids. Right. He's actually a bit introverted, but he seems overwhelmed and he's taking classes for something. I don't want to talk to the guy, so I really don't know all the answers, you know. Right. But you.
16174	Kind of been thinking about, you know, yeah if I really do have ADD, how much different my life would have been if this had been discovered, you know, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago, you know. Six weeks ago. Yeah. So that was kind of bothering me a bit. Are you upset with me for not wondering about it?
16195	Somewhere, I don’t know... early in my... PhD program... I stopped being able to do that. I don’t know exactly why. Something like being acutely aware of what’s going on with you interrupts my thought process, so I... It is not helped by my advisor, who has like, very bright blue eyes and sits very attentively like...
16212	but farthest away from the door and give yourself an extra couple of minutes at each spot. And that can build in, you know. Just 10 minutes of walking during the day, just by doing a couple of things like that. And that’s a manageable way, you know, to be able to walk in places that probably have been plowed. You know they’re going to plow the parking lot. The parking garage is covered  Yeah. And gives you just a few minutes of being a little bit more active; maybe a little bit of fresh air here and there. That’s a way that you can be more in control of what you’re able to do.
16268	My mother was a very neat and kept person. She was very particular about how she kept house and her personal appearance. My dad was a salesman and was well kept, but not more than other people I guess. My siblings, a brother and sister, are messier than I am, most definitely. Are there any forms of abuse in your past as a child or in your current life as an adult? No. No physical or sexual abuse at all. Have you experienced any major losses or grieving?
16278	I just started I don't know what happened, I just came around and I didn't get a B since, you know? But it took me a year, yeah. My mom jokes around that she sent one kid off to Yale, where I went to school, and got another one back, because I changed so much throughout the four years that I was there. So at the time that you started doing better, is that when you started drinking? That's when I stopped drinking. I see.
16279	Not in my mind because it’s feeling better, per se, but I guess for reasons that, at least to me so far, are not entirely clear – maybe because you’re feeling kind of strong, I think? Like I don’t swing violently in this direction, so much as I just saunter over there?
16281	I received an MRI report on Friday that showed I had a herniated disc in my cervical spine, in my neck. To the say
16306	I haven't tried Lunesta either. That's an option. Yeah. Okay, look, I don't mean to derail us in actually talking about what's going on, nor am I convinced that this will solve your sleep problems or that my guy giving you antidepressants right now is even possible, but I think some of this stuff might help. We should probably get the ball rolling on that. I can think of a lot of things. One, if you e-mail me, do you want to use your insurance for it? Yes. Okay.
16344	That seems like an interesting topic for all on its own in terms of if it’s that important to me, why don’t I find it sustaining or something like that? experience is something that’s confining and is limiting your options. That’s a very different thing than something that you’ve proactively committed to and that you feel fulfilled you feel good about fulfilling.
16347	Yeah, there are definitely people who have done things like focus on the Harlem Renaissance, the literature of the Harlem Renaissance, and then completely skipped over the politics behind the Renaissance. I’m like, okay, I guess people do that, like in literature departments and stuff, but it feels very ... Someone in the English department, just focusing on the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance, ignoring politics, makes more sense than someone in Afro Am doing that.
16352	I don’t how, but I have to get in touch with the person I’m supposed to be tutoring. It’s like through one of those websites, so I don’t - Do you like have their contact information? No I don’t, or I do somewhere, but it’s not like my phone. You got it on that iPad? I could actually. Okay. Yeah.
16371	No. That I do it enough. No. You did that often.
16397	But he's in class for something and he's overwhelmed. just get a creepy vibe off him. Yeah, he's just a weird dude. Just a weird dude, you know. But I wouldn't take the chance. Yeah. Ian and I in May are going to spend the night on a battleship. Oh, that's cool. You sleep in the bunks and eat in the mess hall. Neat. They do tours around the battleship and all kinds of activities.
16563	You must be really worried. I am. I don’t know. It’s, I don’t know, hard to be—I don’t know. So worried about something that doesn’t—not able to directly, I don’t know, deal with it or—I don’t know. So, I’m basically just—I go back and forth between, I don’t know, trying not to think about it and, I don’t know, being worried. But we’ll see.
16584	in terms of the amount of responsibility you have for Tanya. I guess that's what I was thinking about. And the way you started today about feeling more of the anger, especially as the exigency of the circumstance is subsiding. I don't want that to get lost, either. I have definitely noted that and I think that's important for us to continue talking about, too. Okay.
16667	You want to separate yourself in some ways so that you can be independent of what's limiting him right now. It does sound like a lot of your worries are coming from not being able to control him, but feeling controlled by his depression. Yeah, that sounds about right. I think it's important that you're not controlled by his depression. I need time in the day to go to Hamden and make my room inhabitable again.
16682	Yeah. I feel like James gets frustrated with me about that or I worry about that. I feel like, "Well, if my life sucks, at least it should suck a new way." Or if it sucks in the same way I should be able to come up with something to do about it. Yeah. I think it's kind of an indication or an illustration of how much you feel like you can really suffer. You had better be by yourself because nobody really wants to hear it, or at least not for very long.
16708	That's probably it. That sounds more like Jess. That's why I'm careful to say that I don't really know, but he just doesn't do the same thing with you. There could be some of that on his side, too, where he feels a little needier for her in a way. You know mom comforting stuff like that. He kind of gives her a hard time because of that, which sometimes kids do. Or is just trying to get attention.
16823	all the other well, yeah, I guess that is a "should", so there you go. There you go. It is really cool, if you break it it is kind of cool. It is that a word that may be does that seem odd to describe...? No. I think if you "should" I think I should call 911 and have you arrested.
16841	spit up some phlegm in the morning but usually you don't throw up, like, dinner in the morning, do you? Only when I order Chinese food, because I eat too much, so it's still in my stomach, you know, 12 hours later, 8 hours later, whatever. It's happened once before. And I woke up yesterday, I had no nausea whatsoever. So I was a little surprised because I figured I was dehydrated
16860	I am afraid that I will get some bad germs that will get into my body and if I don’t lock the door, then someone will come and attack me and my family. If I don’t check the doors and windows and lock everything three times, I just feel that something bad will happen. Then I am afraid that I forgot to lock the doors and windows, so I am repeatedly checking on them. Then I must wash my hands three times because of the germs.
16868	I mean it guess it could, but it could also hurt. And I don’t know which it’ll be. Well, if it hurts, then you stop. This is not signing up for lifetime membership. If it turns out that it’s harmful in some way, then you stop. If it’s useful, if you enjoy it, that’s probably a good thing. If you reconnect with some people you enjoy, those things tend to be good at treating depression. You know, getting involved with activities that are pleasurable. That’s good stuff. And it might be that.
16880	see. I think there’s also the sense that like one of the things I’d like to do in my other relationships is like be aware of the things that people are struggling with and sort of offer to talk with them about them; sort of tell them that I understand this is going on. So I think that I’m trying to do that and realize that our relationship is very different from my other ones, but I think that I’m doing that anyway. So
16944	Well, so he got cardioverted on Tuesday and they said that his heart was like four times the size it's supposed to be, which we knew but it basically hasn't gone down at all. And if it had gone down then there would be like hope. So, there's kind of not much hope that that will continue to happen. You're saying that they're not believing that what they will do, will kind of allow it to shrink again but it's going to stay enlarged.
16948	is to be able to start saying, "You know what? When are you going to go try on clothes because I want to be there for you. I have some time right now." Pushing into to taking care of her some. But I don't think the answer is going to be, oh, you just need to be not taken care of anymore. I think you start to hate yourself when you get taken care of. And that's a healthy thing to want to have in every relationship. Do you know what I mean?
16973	in a way that it would be less likely in other social situations for that to happen. Um... you know, I think it,
16985	Yeah. To some extent, I don't think that's entirely true. I think I have seen you be more in touch here, but what do you think that's about? I'm just assuming it's that same feeling that I know. I've been there. I've felt the intensity when I start to get in touch with whatever feelings it is that I've pushed away and it's just easier for me to probably just do what I've done my whole life from a child. It's easier for me to function and be somewhat together and find things I,
16995	Go buy another shampoo for a dollar, find a cheaper shampoo, you can buy it, hide it so he doesn't use that one and use that one yourself. The car, that's a different story, the fridge is a different story, these are things that start
17007	Are they Ethiopian or not? And also asking one’s source for information and taking that as “This is the truth which we will update Wikipedia with”, is not really a great practice. The professor here was really quite naive, incompetent, and kind of offensive too.
17021	Not particularly about those subjects but those were part of the conversation. So that seems important. When you say talked in that way, how do you mean? Yes, that’s the right question but I don’t know how to answer it. Did you ever like sit and have coffee with someone for a couple of hours? It’s that I think. Sure.
17023	And then you end up intensifying your own thought because you end up saying what you were already saying again. You're reinforcing it because you're fighting against him. I wonder if censoring yourself a little bit to get yourself the response that you want because when you tell him that you feel like killing yourself or you feel like hurting yourself, he's going to say, "It's not that bad. Don't do it," which doesn't make you feel better.
17068	In that case I sort of was helpless without him because I couldn't see anything, which is why I always put my glasses in a place that makes sense and not . . . like he'll lose his and I always put mine somewhere that makes sense. This time he knocked them over.
17095	Yeah. There's also a sense in which how many people need to handle that simultaneously? Someone who is helping you would need to I'm not even talking simply about me, but anyone you would rely on to help you through this. I'm sorry. You're going to have to expand on that a little bit. I was thinking about this before with your siblings. You were kind of bringing a logistical formula. There are this many people and I can only have this many conversations.
17097	And now Yeah, I do. The thing is other people get paid to do exactly what I'm doing. Huh. But by the time I joined the study I feel like she's out of grant money. Oh. So I'm not getting fifteen dollars an hour, I'm getting nothing. It's just frustrating but it's good for my resume. Yeah. And now Friday I start orientation for patient advocacy at Walter Reed. Okay.
17137	That I would be the type of snobby whatever person that being married to someone who is a manager at Subway wouldn't be enough, or wouldn't be fulfilling his potential or wouldn't be - Mm. Like what does that say about me? Hm. So just to press you for a second, does your mind go to something in particular? What are you saying, "What does that say about me?" It seems like you get very self-critical.
17249	My friend, the non-doctor shared this. So I allowed myself to get into a state of hysteria because for whatever reason, we don't have to get into that I guess but I felt very desperate... I think it would be good for you to identify what contributed to your feeling hysterical. Well I think I tend to listen to people that I think are very smart and I look at them...
17260	So the piece that you have control over is can you change the tone and as I sit here and thinking about the two ways to do that are either to delay it until that anger has subsided or to find a way to take that deep breath and then speak in a way that's more calm. I'm not saying that you don't have a right to be angry or that it's not okay to express your anger. The reason I'm saying this is because he's not hearing you and you want him to hear you.
17263	and I would lie to them and tell them that I wasn't doing it, and I had like my separate friends who are surprisingly now, no longer my friends. Yeah, and then I didn't even think about it really, all summer, and it wasn't until I came back to school that those friends again, they had been doing it all summer. So they had it around, so then I gave it another try, and I guess I liked it. I don't remember the second time I did it.
17310	What feels hurtful about being angry? I guess he doesn't like it when I'm angry at him and he thinks it... You know? I mean, I don't like it when people are angry at me. I guess the difference is it feels like... It feels like you have a right to be angry. Yeah. So I don't know what to do. And it's not like I'm taking out my frustrations on, from something else on him. Right. I'm taking my frustrations at him
17315	Yeah. Yeah. Then again, I'm not Tanya's therapist so I feel like, at least occasionally, I've come up with a different answer to that question. You know I think it all would have been so much different if we would have been in San Antonio or in Austin, somewhere close to our families.
17332	It’s terrible. My husband is so understanding, but worried and wants me to get help because it is disruptive in our household. The kids wonder why I must do everything three times and why I can’t touch certain things in the house because of the fear of germs. I don’t want them to learn these things from me. I work as an accountant, so I have my own office and don’t have to interact a lot with the public.
17339	in part of your lack of confidence and, you know, when you're feeling crummy about yourself it can be hard to be motivated and take care of yourself. You feel down, you don't feel like you're worth it, you don't do your laundry. I don't know. Going to the bathroom. Chinese food.
17351	Done. Days are , so like It stinks. Yeah. So the metaphor is, you know, how many spoons do you have? Are there a lot of spoons? Lucy made the analogy that, hanging out with Yvonne is like having Yvonne take all of my spoons and drops them down the garbage disposal.
17391	I think it relates to some knowledge of or trust in response, what response I will get immediately and where it will go from there, I think. And how might it go wrong? On the one hand, and this is not as much an issue in our relationship, but the other person may not be able to handle it. That one is alleviated by some sort of professional trust, in this case. Mitigated not really.
17431	Things that do change mood sure, medication is one of them. We kind of know, from working backwards, people take these drugs and have a lot of changes in their moods. The other things that change mood are things that do take some of that motivation and energy, things like exercising, exposure to light.
17500	Yes. I would like to get your help because I feel like I can’t live my life. I am not wanting to be around groups of people. I feel irritable and have been having trouble concentrating and remembering things. I don’t have an appetite and feel nauseated a lot lately. I am 28 years old and feel like an old lady. Can you tell me when these symptoms started?
17504	And I pass the bum on the street every day, and I think I'm going to be just like her because she she is. But homeless people I wonder whether she is less or more depressed than you; I have a hunch. It might be less. She reads. She may
17553	I'm wondering how much that piece of advice that you got kind of got you ramped up and got you worried; got you scared and got you feeling depressed because you did not like the job search process. No, I really didn't. I don't know. I can't go back to being unemployed. I need to have something right away. Listen to this fear. I don't know. My parents will . . . Feeling trapped. Yeah.
17568	No, that's right. That's right. It's sort of like, through the lens of the illness I have come to see this more clearly or something. Yes. Yeah. And that is... yeah, no, I think that's a really nice insight I was not... That thought flitted through my head once two days ago, and I haven't looked at it since. And I think that visiting her family and being frustrated by, like, everyone in her family, like, extended family included, being... having a particular sense of ethic is...
17579	of that it was a very huge, pivotal point in my life, and then when I got better and actually met, had like a girlfriend and everything, pretty much three months later all of this started to happen. The physical symptoms?
17603	oh, it burns. Marie tried it and said don't do it, like oh my God, you already did them, there's something not right with that. I don't know what it is but that like, I'm not doing any more. Yeah, I mean, it
17672	We do need to stop though, but I’ll see you tomorrow. Okay. Okay great. Okay take care.
17685	That it’s not, that I have, that not only am I sharing it, but that you’re sort of, you’re seeing that there are certain... sort of areas that I have very clear ideas about. Like, it’s something that I’ve thought about and developed, it’s not random or like, maybe this or maybe that. No, I want to know what you’re thinking, but I think maybe
17731	had stopped taking it Friday or before so while I really don't think that that is like a primary driver of her depression and just all of the turmoil of the last couple of years, she did have a goiter in part of her thyroid removed and has been doing thyroid suppression therapy since about the time we got married. So it fits right into the same time window as everything else.
17740	Do you think if you can step back and be a little objective in considering that that what you held was somewhat of an unrealistic expectation? Yes. Disappointing, but yes. The good news is you're probably going to live a little bit longer, oh at least 90 years -that was a joke
17753	the website to apply for them was like so slow and broken I was just like, "Screw this. I'm not spending..." I hadn't written the cover letter yet so like I, you know... So it wasn't like I expended that much effort only to not apply but it was just... You know, it's one thing to have a really application where you have to fill out the things and basically like replicate your resume and then they ask you for your resume too but if the site won't even load,
17780	I think it does have to do a lot with the fact that I didn't, I felt my mother was very loving towards me when I was in a good mood and when I was down or upset she would push it right away and say "You're complaining and I don't want to hear it," and when my mother used to say you're like a doormat and so there was
17805	It’s on the…it’s on the third floor, but the ground floor is one, so it’s two; two flights up. So those are ways to look for little bits more. Uh huh. Maybe on days when you’re not carrying as heavy of a load, choosing the stairs up on the way. Choosing the stairs up as well as choosing the stairs down are little ways for you to take control of where you can get in just a little bit more movement in your day.
17833	And that's okay. But I don't know if that's what I I don't know if it's okay with me. Mm hm.
17862	So, like, the particularly bad period of our lives, she has essentially no memories from. What were you wondering? It's interesting because it was sort of related to that. There's one piece of dealing with Tanya's illness in the present and then also in the past, which is sort of a traumatic event, for lack of a better term, that you went through, that you feel completely alone in and you can't share with her because she was there and not there at the same time.
17902	Let’s give the Seroquel some more time to work. You’ve been on it for a week. It sounds like it’s helping a little. Let’s see what happens. How has things like, I know it’s been snowy. Have you been able to exercise at all. No, I haven’t. Because that’s sometimes, you know, when that’s more available to you, that can really help because the tightness is muscles. Right. That’s a muscle tightening that you’re feeling. It’s really uncomfortable. It’s not dangerous, but it’s really uncomfortable. And that’s something that exercise can really help with.
17912	I also get the feeling that there's a lot of feeling. You know you say sometimes you hit these moments where you're watching something and all this feeling comes out, like a release almost, and then you feel better. It has that feeling to me, like there's something dammed up inside. Probably. Even just from what you went through Friday.
17919	I don't know. I don't know. It sort of makes it easier to justify like behaving in this fashion. I'm not sure that that's actually the I don't know. Well, I think this is the heart of the matter in your marriage, is how free are you how free are you? Maybe that's the end of the sentence. And how much are you as you described very pointedly, held hostage? You'd certainly feel more
17931	And as I'm going in, this guy asked me if I had a cigarette and I'm like "no" and he's like "Can I used your phone?" And I don't know why I asked, but I'm like "Who are you calling?" And he rambles off some Italian guy, and then he kind of stops. He's like "Who are you?" You know, like maybe he shouldn't be giving me the number. Right.
17964	I don't know what's going to happen the rest of today. I really hate this. And I hope. I mean at some point I have to listen to the rest of my messages. I hope I'll be able to do that soon, but I don't know. I know it's not that much to deal with, but it feels like too much. My Dad's coming tomorrow. We'll see how that goes. Mm hm.
17982	- Right, and then I was worried if I went to the pub I’d actually get ill in the pub and then it’d be really embarrassing for everybody so I just said I couldn’t go, and I think he’s getting a bit to the end of his tether now, because it just seems to have come out of the blue, and I’ve never suffered from anything like this before. So it sounds like he’s getting to the end of his tether, but it also sounds like you’re pretty fed up with the whole thing as well - is that right?
17987	No. Fine, so yeah until now. Yes it would be wonderful if I could change, I mean, if anyway... No, wait. Have we not already seen some changes for the better in your attitude to yourself? Maybe a little bit but I feel like I'm extremely, I feel like I'm still sort of up and down with these things because it takes.
18016	I have a tough time with the people from James’s grad school grad program. It’s just always sort of stressful. I like them; they’re fine; they’re just really different from me. Then I think well, they’re also really different from James.
18032	You said, you know. I don't know. I was thinking about something else. Cameron, I don't think you have enough self-confidence in yourself when it comes to lots of things. We already knew that. How does that explain why I have a ton of laundry that I needed to do two weeks ago? I think you feel kind of crummy about yourself as a result
18046	We have to get visas for this trip to China and my dad won't make up his mind whether he wants to deal with getting visas for everyone or whether he wants me and Dave to get our own. I e-mailed him to say, "The trip is in four months. We need to get our visas. Do you want me to mail you our passports and visa applications so you can get everyone's visas?
18071	Well, to some extent. I mean he clearly He said he left grad school because it wasn't for him. And I had a really tough time with that. But that was something I was going to be able to accept. What actually happened, not so much. But the bare problem with it is, I feel like Ivan has no clue what he wants out of life right now. Yeah. I feel like if I told him tomorrow, "We should buy a house." He would be like, "Yeah, let's work up towards that." Mm.
18091	But he wants to do a bumper car which entails adding wood to the top which, you know — Why do you have to add wood to the top for a bumper car? Just the way a bumper car is shaped. Oh, okay. The size of the block is not big enough, so you've got to build up the back. I see.
18092	Yeah. I definitely know it about myself. I think my whole life it was the comfortable place for me to be. I think also maybe anger has always been the easiest feeling me to express. I couldn't tell if you said express or suppress? Express. Express. That is what I was guessing. What do you think about anger that makes it easier?
18098	Last night I had a long last night I had an hour long conversation with my friend Vanessa I just gotten 10 year last week.
18107	It's interesting. It's a dynamic that's gotten set up with her, it sounds like since you were very little. Yeah. Very much so. I mean, not only is she taking care of me now, but when things with mom and dad were explosive, she was there to talk it out and make sure I was OK. But even to the extent of, "Ramona, did you do this? Do you want to take care of this? How is that going?" Just really mothering. Mm.
18126	he always seems like current time or jag, but there’s no guarantee about the next one will come. Yeah. Sorry I’m taking a little time to figure this out. Okay. I’ll be. I could probably go home to stare at the wall, so you know, I can do that here.  Do you have a? No. I don’t know
18128	This all happened this week so if you wallowed for two weeks and then I'd say, well it's starting to look like depression because it's stuck around for so long. But sticking around for most of a week is still considered within normal range for reacting to sad news and difficult things. Yeah, I mean on my little run this morning I decided it's better than what could have happened last year and I think it has mostly because Josh was a reason.
18142	I was just thinking about Amanda. I feel like from where I sit, it looks to me a lot like she is bi-polar, too, and she does not succumb to it. She doesn’t want to be involved in mental health care, basically. She doesn’t want to take meds and – okay. I don’t know. I wonder how her life would be different if she were not making that choice. Like if she were getting treated and thinking more of herself in those terms, stuff like that? Yes.
18145	Well, I don't know. Just like in general, depression lies to the self so I mean it's like I know there are times when I know I'm not right, I mean like when I'm feeling like, 'oh, I would be better off if I were dead,' so I mean there's the rational part of my back in the back of my mind that's like, 'no that's not true.' That's just the depression lying to you. Does anxiety lie in the same way? I guess. Sort of. How might it?
18149	On any given, any given relationship any given day, you're not being selfish by having your sister wait a little bit while you try on clothes. It could be if she said to you, "Ramona, I have thirty minutes and then I have to be out of here because I have a job interview. So let's do thirty minutes and then " You know, say you were driving her. And then you kept trying on clothes and totally ignoring her deadline. I'm guessing that's not what happened. Right? No, no. She didn't say she had limited time.
18162	doing it. That's what happens when your brain is preoccupied with staying safe. And your brain became very preoccupied with staying safe as you became really
18186	Parenting a regular little kid looks different from what they’re doing. I mean it’s not obvious from this, but I mean I’m child trained, and I until a few years ago, saw kids, you know, and. Parenting; it can be incredibly hard, and hard to know how hard it can be to parent a difficult kid,
18225	Doctors who are overscheduled and will only see you for ten minutes really don't know as much about your body as you do because... It does not necessarily mean the answers are on some blog on the Internet. Right. So Dave started yelling that I didn't want to try this vitamin D thing and I was like, "Well, you're suggesting that I take something like 12 times the FDA recommended allowance of vitamin D.
18227	What do you make of looking for Victor Street? My obsession with him, as David puts it. Yea, this is so much crap attached to that whole thing. It's just so weird. Yea, the best everyone is doing are just ignoring it and nothing can matter again. Yea, I don't think about it now. I was asking about like, will we ever be OK with him. Or I don't know. I mean, he was a good friend. And now he's not even that. Yea, there's so much weirdness to that episode. I see him on Facebook or David says stalk him or I don't know.
18301	wait until you have run out and get it a few days later, but There are a couple of questions that I have. One is what are you worried about in sort of saying in the moment when you're feeling upset about something like this? I mean we've talked since when Tanya was here that she has a hard time handling me being upset and so like I am concerned that me being angry is going to impact her negatively in a dangerous way. Is the dangerous part the important part?
18312	Then that, that there is certainly intentionality, you’re imputing that I’m I’m not feeling like I’m going to a particular direction, consciously, but...
18320	And you know yourself well. I trust that, ultimately, you want to be safe and you take the steps to do that.
18323	No, not at all, it’s just I keep getting these situations where my heart starts to really, really race like boom, boom. - Right, I get chest pain, I can’t catch my breath. It’s making me feel funny talking to you about it! Right - And, um, so my heart starts to race, I can’t get my breath and then I get chest pains and I get very afraid that, I’m going to have a heart attack. Right, and you’re feeling a little bit anxious just here with me?
18330	It seems very honest. Yeah. Like, you know, it'd be one thing if I knew like going into this relationship that he had really low libido but like when he's not depressed he doesn't and he's starting to get better but then he had like a cold that like, you know, he's had for three weeks and so that's making things hard even if he is getting better mentally. Like he's not better physically and...
18341	like agitation that I did something inappropriate by sending these updates.” I was like, “Well, I’m pretty upset that stuff that I was talking about in my psychiatrist appointment is in the e-mails.” And he’s like, “There’s nothing different than the ones he sent in the last hospitalizations, which you were fine with.” I was like, “Well, it seems like there’s a big difference to me between saying, ‘Tanya had a rough
18354	Somewhat mitigated. Let's take a different one. Say I was to talk to my mother about Tanya's relationship with this professor. I don't know how my mother would respond, but it could go that my mother gets angry or hurt and then I have to deal with those also; and that hasn't helped me at all. So you said "mitigated," not alleviated.
18359	felt thoughtful and proactive and driven by a passion for something. Passion for sandwich even. You know? Like, you know, he's starting to learn about all different kinds. I mean that still might be disappointing in one way if it was sort of, "Oh, I thought I was marrying someone who was going to this." And, "What does that mean for his identity?" And, you know, "Can I get used to that?" But maybe not in all the ways it's been disappointing because of something in his personality or attention deficit.
18373	And, I also think that this, being that I'm working full time and he's working part time and it's, you know, way less. It's two days a week. Well, it's four days a week, but hours wise it's about maybe 12 hours a week. I just feel like that should make our life easier because Harold has time to do a lot of things that I'm still doing. I'm still cooking. I'm still doing the food shopping. A lot of times when I bring it up, he says, you know, why don't you ask me? I say why should I have to ask you?
18392	and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work, you’re feeling a bit stressed out, and in town it was a bit hot - so that may have been what was behind that first panic attack. What happens to people is that once they’ve had one panic attack they go on to have more, and the reason for that is that once you’ve had something like that happen to you, you’re kind of there thinking, ’ooh will this happen again.’ Is that something that you do?
18396	Yeah, I don't know what to do about it. Yeah, I mean, I don't know what to do about it. Yeah, I feel like you're pointing to this thing and I'm saying, "yes, that seems like about the right thing." Now what? Yeah. Um hmm. You know, we can spend time talking about that more, but
18397	Yeah, I don't have a particularly clear view of what a tenable strategy is at this point. Well, when one feels really, really angry at the person or people they love, being worried about the impact of that anger, I think, is a general fear. I mean, I think that's kind of a fear in general that you might have regardless of Tanya's psychologic state... Sure. And then it's exacerbated by it. So what do people do?
18412	So I’m going to move on to the other questions now. I asked you, I think, at the end of the last session that had you ever been suicidal and whether you would lie to me. You were struck by the pairing of those questions.
18425	Just the fact that I came up being sad for no reason and it's breaking through means that my drugs aren't working enough if I'm having these bad feelings. They're not being triggered by a certain thing. So you're not happy all the time? Yeah, but sadder than usual, though. So you do feel like this is worse than whatever your baseline is? Yeah. Usually my baseline would be if I'm sad there's a reason for it.
18433	I don't know. I don't feel like I should deserve to feel secure. And just the knowledge that I am that I exist. I don't know. I want to play the blame game. But I'm like did this come from a did this sense of you have to do something. You have to do something otherwise, it's awful. I wonder if this comes from David, but well, it's also the reason you seek him out.
18438	I mean we woke up and the car battery was dead because he couldn't remember to turn off the light. I mean he's been using shampoo to wash his body for over a month because he can't remember to take his new bar of soap into the shower. I mean things actually happen that affect me so it's not like we've been down the road, I can let it go, or I should let it go and it just falls on him and maybe he'll learn consequences, the whole...It doesn't happen. He doesn't get worked up about the consequences, I do and they affect me too.
18482	father's abusive marriage and so forth, but it would be much more likely to be the parents and not the spouse, especially for people in their 20s who would be managing this, like all of it.
18485	and like basically said that I would not have chosen to tell my mom for example, or James’ mom, or you know, my little brother. Like I love them, but it’s not necessarily even that I don’t want them to know, but I didn’t know that they – like I didn’t know that when I was having these conversations with James, that anything in the conversations was fair game,
18486	Pressuring him to pay her, I don’t know, a couple thousand dollars or something. My brother’s just turned 27. This woman is 41 years old. I don’t know. I don’t know. She knows about our situation. He doesn’t have any money. I don’t know. He has problems with depression. I don’t know. Just quit his job and he’s not feeling too hot right now. I don’t know. I guess. He didn’t tell me the whole story, but I’m sure something happened where she abandoned him and
18532	But I choose sleep. So, I don’t really know how to do anything. My whole life is falling apart. You’ve got a lot of challenges right now, so let’s just focus on one piece. Like you said, it’s hard to make all of the right decisions, which sometimes feels harder to make. So let’s take it just a couple of days at a time and focus on making one or two decisions that feel like they’re towards health. So it’s Wednesday evening and you said you had some, you have some plans. You’re going to go to your mom’s after the doctor on Friday. Yeah.
18542	If I said, "We should start a family tomorrow." He would probably That might be a little extreme, but the point is I feel like he's been wishy washy. One random job to the next. Mm. And just, you know, going with whatever is given to him. Just not proactive, not engaged, not motivated or ambitious. Mm hm. What does he What does he really want?: Mm.
18560	Yeah, they're doing some painting. Probably the next time it'll be the new furniture. Oh wow. Yeah. So painting and furniture. Rugs. So I defended my dissertation. Oh, congratulations. Thank you. How did it go? It went fine. It was not the best presentation I've ever given, but it was good enough, so.
18567	...then it's not really working for you either because you're not being able to express really what you want. Yeah. It's just that then... I don't know what to do other than try to be calm when I'm not calm. And like if a fight is happening I'm very much not calm. Can you delay the conversation until you are calm? Umm... Maybe. I mean, the last time it was in the context of trying to wake him up on Saturday morning and Friday night he did the thing where he like stayed up late and then like...
18583	It's entirely possible that the Wellbutrin wasn't working because it was manufactured incorrectly and not because it was ineffective on my body, so I really don't know. I've just gotten to the point that if I'm medicated and still feeling depressed and there is nothing I can do, there are very few options left to me because we tried the mood stabilizer and that gave me weird side effects, too. It really seems like Wellbutrin and Desipramine are the two drugs that are for depression and have absolutely no serotonin side effects,
18602	Yea, I guess. I mean, I'm sure I I'm trying to think if there were times in my life where I was less insecure. But I don't know. I might have been. But I might have still been insecure about other things. Even as a child or something. And it's like,
18606	liked to party or whatever, and they did cocaine, so I thought this would be fun, if we all get together and I'll get us a gram of coke to split and we can go out in Chicago and have a good time.
18635	That would be my easiest meal. Other things would take a lot more work, like practically any meals. I could stock pasta that would be fine and write "Georgia" on it, but I have to go to Hamden if I want to have anything to put on it. Getting vegetables you can't get them that far in advance. Anything else . . . It would still require planning if Sydney wound up going to my place and having things for the morning and everything. Yeah, it feels complicated. It is. The gluten-free kitchen is probably the most complicating factor that plus Aaron not really doing his job of getting food for the kitchen.
18676	In the end that was kind of like, the nut of it, I was just like, “Hmmm, this feels very uncomfortable”. I would imagine. It was not touched on at all. Also part of her, in part of her talk she was discussing how a lot of her African-American and African students didn’t do a lot with technology and are underrepresented in the tech field.
18678	I'm clear that when we've talked about this before, I put it in a very direct manner, Tanya's tendency to abdicate her responsibility and your tendency to fill in all the spaces of responsibility, whether it's your responsibility or not, even your entitlement or not to do so, does not fit well. I mean, in some ways it fits very well, but in others It works perfectly together. It worked perfectly except it doesn't help either of you.
18714	I noticed you were wearing dressier clothes than usual. Yes. That was on purpose. So, like maybe they'll be able to start me with something as soon as Monday. If they could that would probably solve the problem at least while I'm at work and then I guess I'll have to deal with the panic in the evenings, but - If you even panicked.
18759	You were surrounded by judges as a kid. So many judgments from your mother and from your mother's whole side of the family. Things are either good/bad; good/bad; good/bad not just interest in your experience.
18768	Were you treated for depression or any other mental issues in the past, such as after your mother’s passing? No. I just recently went to Dr. Green because this is becoming too much. Would you be willing to try medication, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Exposure and Response Prevention therapy to begin changing these behaviors? Yes. If it will help me stop this and be able to have my life back.
18779	But he doesn't know what else to say, so he says it. So if you can tell him what you want, "I'm sad. I'd like a hug. Can you hold me?" Yeah, especially because "it's going to be okay" is something that works on him.
18791	It's all related because I do have all of those things, but I actually, how it came to be is some long time ago, I asked you whether this would be your first child and you said it would be your first biological child. So a couple of weeks ago, then, I sort of…and I phrased that question very carefully to avoid asking the question that I then later asked to like…I did that because. Anyway.
18850	" He said "I don't think you should confront Ivan." I told him I didn't know what to do here and I was hoping...he really just kind of told me to just...so it was unfortunate and he kind of gave me like a short list of what he needed and he never called me back, not even to check like "How's it going?" I think that's his way of...so I understand Ivan maybe avoids him sometimes and maybe he learned that a little bit at home. Yeah.
18897	And suggested that that had been true for that it had never not been true. You know, it sounds sort of ridiculous, but I think I don't think she's correct about that. I think there was a period of time where it certainly was not every couple or three days or something. I'm not sure that's really the important point, though.
18925	I just because it’s such a difference from, I don’t know, my interaction with her or being—she was so strong or unwavering or she comes off like—I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know, probably like how I come off, just blunt or something. I don’t know, it’s just—and then now, it’s—I don’t know. It’s not about sports or—I don’t know. She’s just like, yeah, doesn’t want any part or doesn’t know how to deal with it or—I don’t know.
18968	So the one I disputed... And let me point out to you teandency you have. And you know we're on the same page The journey of Jessa having a better life. Yes. When I point out things to you, it is to help you to be more aware. Of course, yeah.
18974	Yeah, your body sort of triggers that to do it.
18994	So just watch that. OK. And if you catch yourself not to tell yourself, "Oh, Goodness! Look at me hopeless," blah-blah, but... Right. Tell yourself something like... "Oh, there I went again. OK, now I go back to where I was." OK.
18996	that has a bed in it so Candace could stay with us, I did all of that work. So particular, you know, just how guests. So maybe the more important things is Candace got in on Wednesday when Tanya was at work and so Candace and I sat and talked for a while. Then her sister I don’t know if I knew this and had forgotten it, but I think that I knew this. Her sister is bipolar and that was a real struggle with
19035	And it's just hard for me to look at Ivan and be, this is horrible, but to be satisfied - Mm hm. with the way that. So the only way I am coping with it is thinking, "This is just for now." Yeah. "He's trying to get on his feet. It's not the end of the world." This is actually the best job he has ever had in his life so far. Like the most responsibilities, the most skills to be developed. Mm hm. By far.
19063	Maybe but . . . If that was the case. You don't know if they're really pissed, but if they were is there something you could do to ease that? Other than spending more time at my place which, again, would require this planning or to have stuff to eat, because it's not like you've given others anything to eat, which is really annoying. Who does the shopping for food at Sydney's place? Everybody does their own food shopping, so people have different shelves of the fridge that are theirs.
19081	You know, I feel like it's things that have to be done that have to be done the second we both... Why should I be the one that has to say, you know, take the garbage out because it's Tuesday? You want to feel like he's chipping in and maybe even trying to take care of you? Yeah, I'd like to feel like, you know, I mean I guess my image of Harold retiring was that there would be some more time for him to take care of me because,
19088	I don’t know. I don’t know. I guess there’s just been a lot of stress and I’m worried. I don’t know. Because I know one his really good friends— I think his name is Harris. I usually always contact him when I’m worried about Stephen, but he was out of town. Yeah. I don’t know. His roommate is—I don’t know. Never get the phone. his phone is always off. So, whenever I try to contact him, I’m always—I don’t know. It’s only been ten years later. I don’t know.
19093	Oh yes, yes. Perhaps less politely than I would have liked. Can you tell me how that frustrated you? Yes, I guess I started the summary of the things that happened that week by saying that I did all the preparations for Candace to come visit. That takes time in addition to like spending some time with Candice, it took all weekend to sort of catch up on the things that
19137	Yeah. Harold doesn't understand that. I don't know if men just don't understand that. His theory is part of feeling that way is because we're not being intimate. If we would just be more intimate we would be able to handle those kinds of things better. I see, you know, I understand what he's saying, but it doesn't work like that for me. So what do you think of that? You're here to feel more in touch with your emotions and it's having the opposite effect.
19141	yeah, I guess I'm stuck on, can't know. It's not that I don't accept, like... yeah, obviously I cannot know, there is not a... but I feel like you're making a stronger claim than that, like, I cannot project with any reasonable certainty, that like, yeah, it's not 50-50, but I can't tilt it much past 55-45 or something. Well, then maybe I'm not giving you enough credit so far as not knowing what you feel she can and can't handle. No, I... you know, you're probably right. I just... I can't...
19156	" I'm like"No!"Yeah I wonder what your picturing when you say "I need more help." What looks...what would help? In theory I think it would come from our sets of parents. In theory it would be someone who could be calling him and checking up and finding out what's going on and be really like on board with his treatment plan and...I don't know if I should call it that but....Maybe for me somebody whose able to call and just "How's it going?"
19179	But I mean the, the hard part, the letting them know you've been looking is probably the harder part to craft than the, "Hello so and so." So I have faith in you. You can do scary things if you can get through panic attacks, which we know you can, you can do this too. Okay. I will see you next week at the regular time. Okay. Still nothing from the insurance?
19226	Yeah, I feel like, you’re a post-doc at Cambridge, put effort in, come on. And I’m kind of like, part of me is like did you get handed this last-minute, were you not initially supposed to speak? Is this a failure to prepare? Do you really not understand the racial politics? Are you just not talking about them? Because you don’t want to be controversial? This may be very naive on my part, but I would imagine the white person in African-American studies would have thought about,
19229	And he was like, okay, I quit. And I’m like thanks. Like it just feels so hopeless and I was considering like, I didn’t go in to work yesterday either because I was sick on Monday and yesterday I, like Monday night, I was feeling really suicidal and bad and depressed and I guess it wasn’t…maybe I wasn’t even suicidal. It was like the physical feeling of uncomfortableness and tightness from anxiety. That’s what I was feeling. That’s what I was feeling. So there wasn’t a thought, at that point.
19231	This was, this is a very Cecilia piece thing to say. You start elaborating on it. You have an idea and then you stop. And then you ask me. No. Because I'm saying I'm telling that, for me, it's something that's full of anxiety so I'm not really sure if that is freedom or if it's not. Whether freedom and anxiety could go together? I guess they do. But I'm saying, for me, they do. I haven't asked other people if that's the thing for them too.
19248	He can do it because he doesn't feel uncomfortable eating in his room, but it does seem problematic that he's feeling the need to retreat so much and it's uncomfortable for you feeling like well one, it's uncomfortable for you to kind of break this rule for yourself of eating in the bedroom, but also because you're kind of being forced to hide as well. It doesn't feel good to hide in a place where you're really living. I know, because my place seems unlivable, too. I think I just have to hold out another two months until September.
19263	Ok. So, you know, I started to try and avoid situations where I might get like that, basically. Right, so what kind of things are you finding yourself avoiding?
19299	it’s a little more show than tell. Mm-mm. You know like with Yvonne, you see it all over the place, Yeah. And you sort of see it demonstrated in how she talks. Yeah. But it’s not exactly what she’s talk – I don’t know if it’s what she’s talking about or not. No, it is. Yeah. How so?
19366	stopped thinking about work tasks, because it's only like two blocks away from here, so just from one place to the other. A short transition.
19389	And I wonder if having, you know, setting up some time to go to a place to go to separate from him that you're not reliant upon him being up at a certain time for you to go... Yeah. ...if that might, if that might actually feel good. It might. And then I'll get out of the house and like at least be doing something. Yeah. You get out of the house. You see someone. Yeah. Not that I'm necessarily that productive, but that's okay. But you get up and out.
19392	You'd feel less dependent on him for your day. Yeah. Except I... Yeah. I'm still not up for the past three weeks have stuck with the one application a week. You've gotten that in? Yep. Good job. Except that I have been gone and I actually did get two e-mails from two different physicians that I applied to that I did not get the position. But you don't... You have control of the sending it in piece.
19419	Because on the one hand I just cannot do this anymore, like I can't do this for five more seconds. On the other hand it's okay because I need to take care of him and he needs my help right now and he's my husband and he's really struggling but it's just like he won't get the help he needs. Actually Ramona, you're struggling too. But it doesn't matter! It does to me. But it doesn't even... Listen, it does to me. It does matter, it does matter.
19475	Even if I didn't have these stressors I might be feeling just as bad and it's just my brain not working and there's nothing I can do about my brain chemistry. I feel like the only way to control brain chemistry is through meds. I don't know how much trying to think differently would change that. What weds you to the idea of brain chemistry?
19492	OK, sorry. I get excited. I... Good. I'm glad. You seem less depressed. I am. See Even though we haven't finished the process. No, I... Is there some more disputing you would do? Yeah. And then is there not another step? Yes, there is another step and there is more disputing. OK.
19525	was really getting upset and I feel like it's now starting to effect, I don't know what I should say here but I feel like it's...not 'should' but, I feel like it's affecting my relationship as well and
19548	It's usually there. A lot of the stuff that I talked about a long time ago like the checking after flushing the toilet, usually that doesn't happen so much anymore. So that's a difference in your daily life, your having to combat things like that? Yeah. Maybe because I'm not feeling depressed every single day,
19550	Also, it matters because I don't want to just send a passport to this travel agent. I need a booking code or something so that the travel agent knows who these passports are for. I ended up reading the whole log of items and e-mails between my family and myself about this stupid fucking trip and I didn't realize until I read them all together in every single regard about this trip planning, they've been disrespectful and dishonest with me.
19569	When they're little they don't go flying into to each other; they just kind of bang into each other and fall down. They don't know what they're doing unless they have another brother, and then they dominate. I notice that with soccer. All the kids with older brothers were much better. I had a kid who scored seven goals who has two older brothers. They play with them more and they have to play up to their brothers.
19570	, then the converse is also naïve. Nothing’s perfect, so anything is okay is... equally ridiculous, really. Well, that’s sort of a permission, a blanket permission, then that’s a problem. That’s, yeah, and it often feels that way to me. It’s like, “Well, you know, we can’t make it perfect, so we might as well just not try to do anything at all.”
19647	play "woe is me," or... ...Unless you let myself. ...Unless I allow myself to. And when you make yourself depressed about either your physical condition or your doing this process imperfectly, what is the effective new philosophy?
19649	working placed with the exception of, you know, I know people who are working at libraries. And that is great except that because the system is so centralized that they have the same HR Department like doing the interviews for all of university like and like having been told when I was working at one department and asked about if like if I was to apply to somewhere at the university, you know, would knowing them help. And they say they don't get to see the applications or anything until it's like whatever stage, you know, maybe like the last round of interviews or something.
19662	And if you don’t feel better, stay there. I guess the first question is, does that seem – am I putting you in a reasonable position; I don’t want to put you in a position where you’re having to make a decision that’s overwhelming to you sitting waiting in the ER. And if that’s the case - Yeah, no, I mean if it starts to feel absurd to be there, then I’ll come home. I guess my question is, will they let me just leave? I don’t know. I would have assumed so, but I don’t know.
19688	I am on my own now and away from all of that. What about your children? Have they been exposed to any abuses? No way. I make sure that they are not left with anyone other than my sister and my grandmother - when she was alive. They don’t have sleep overs and they know about good and bad touch. How old are your daughters? One is five and one is seven. They are good girls.
19718	However, when one comes up with very clear "shoulds"... You kind of see... ...And you're not in a feeling of depression for days and months, and weeks... Right. ...It is fairly safe to assume that it is not the biochemical, but your "shoulds" that are creating or largely creating it. True. That makes sense, yeah. You know? It is it
19726	Yeah. Like yeah. Thank you for not explaining to me how both of those can be true. Sorry, I've been, I've had a lot of people stuff to me this week. Right. Like, “Yeah; no, no, I got it.”
19732	" And when you think about networking what you really want to think about is a branch of networks that are all interconnected and you don't know which one goes where. You start with the one piece you know and ask them to cast a wide net and then you hope that someone in that net, if they don't have something that works for you, they cast a wide net and that's what networking is. It's connecting people from different places to the mutual benefit of those two people that end up connecting in a new network and you're...
19741	Well, that I didn't feel at all. I think the thing is like it can only, it has to be something that takes up my entire like consciousness and stuff. Driving I can still think about other things. Walking to the post office I think about other things and so there I can just do these things while panicking whereas rehearsal like once I get into it is like, you know, takes up all my - You get absorbed in it. Yeah, so - It seems like
19802	And Sydney was like, oh well, you know. First he was like trying to help, but then I shot down his idea and then he got mad at me.
19808	The people who live in R.I. can apply for all the jobs in New Haven and Wallingford and stuff; but people who live in New Haven and Wallingford can't apply for R.I.. They'd be instantly rejected unless their cover letter had something that had they could move to R.I. for the job. I wonder if having a PO box in R.I. would be . . . except that it would be a PO box and they'd know that, so I don't think I have any friends who live in R.I. proper who I could pretend to be living with.
19813	“I know, but it’s interesting, right?” She was like, “Yes!” So that was good. But then like the second time she visited, we were sort of doing the same thing, and I don’t remember exactly what she said, but like something like touched in her, or like very much sort of hit me. And I’m like,
19839	like drives me crazy. Half the time, I like really just want it gone any way possible. So if the only thing that will make you…if you try those other things and it doesn’t go way and you’re at a place where you can’t stand and you want…
19848	Right, ok....call me Audry. Ok, I am the psychiatrist over here.... Ok. - Now what is...Audry....can I ask you how old are you Audry? How old, oh don’t, you’re only as old as the woman you feel aren’t you? I feel quite young and better than most women in their twenties. Right ok, so how old would that make you Audry?
19850	Nonetheless you have courageously demonstrated that even when you're suffering in those ways, you're able to make some helpful effort and change. Thank you. Gently, gently. So what am I telling myself? To make yourself depressed. Let's see...we'll start from morning. "You can't do your job efficiently..." And?
19865	...And disputing and disputation disputing and disputing, so that you create healthy emotions. Can you see? Oh, it is amazing. Uh-huh. Can I ask you, though I wanted to ask you this last week, actually do you feel, in being so experienced in REBT, that you need that the person I don't even want to say "should," but
19878	I was thinking there are a couple of pieces in that. One is that it's helpful to know why I'm not just commenting on the timeline of when you bring it up, but she may actually not think it impacts her mood the way you feel it might and so that's a useful conversation to have. It's also a conversation she really doesn't like having. She really doesn't like it when I suggest that this I have watched this thing impact her mood. Do you know why she doesn't' like it?
19888	Sometimes just the sensation of warmth or pressure can help to distract you from the other sensations that you’re feeling. Like you can really only feel one thing at a time, either pressure or temperature. The nerve endings are the same, so sometimes if you kind of confuse your body by giving it a new temperature, it starts to not really notice the pressure as much. So can this be a way, I mean you can feel both at the same time, but if you can wait, it sort of distracts you.
19897	Last January I was having a horrible time. I may have just before or just after having run away for some period of time, I don't know exactly, but I forced myself to go meet my parents and a friend of mine for dinner and I think it was right after Josh's ablation, first one. So he was in bad shape. I was in terrible shape and he said to my friend next to me that you know he was worried that Josh was going to die.
19903	Kind of not having much to say I think is working pretty hard not to lose it right now. So, I'm not really sure why. I mean it's just because my nose runs so much. Just why is this happening to me? Why is this my life? I'm so sorry that it is. Thanks.
19937	Yeah. I feel like you're either hoping that they can handle the same circumstance better or that for them the circumstance is less acute somehow. The only person I've talked to about Tanya's relationship is my best friend and that's because Tanya almost told him or told him most of it, but not enough, so he called me and said "what's going on?"
19939	Yeah. I'm really glad he finally got over the whole not seeing the doctor thing and then he's like, "Should I go in for an actual check up?" And I'm like, "Yes. You haven't had one in three years." So like sometimes we make progress but sometimes we still fight and like, you know, I was just so afraid on Saturday that like, you know, maybe we'll never be able to figure it out. And like I don't know a good solution other than don't sad mad when I'm mad or like have to keep everything in until I feel more calm which like I guess is the mature adult thing to do. But like I feel like then I don't get to accurately
19945	I said, "Why don't you book us straight from Boston because the surcharge from the travel agency is less than the cost of a plane ticket from Boston to L.A. In summary, please book us from Boston." He replies and says, "We booked you from L.A. You can call the travel agent if you want to go from Boston." I said, "But you asked me and I said, ‘Book from Boston.'" He was like, "We don't know your schedule."
20001	- I want to talk to the head person, I’m fed up with talking to the old nag rag, I want to talk to the engineer, the driver of this unit...no more monkeys. I want to talk to the top person, top boss, top dog, that’s who I want to talk to.
20017	so... It’s sort of like... you know, you were giving, in many ways, a very complex level of theory and... to... you know, it’s, I guess... it’s simple, in that it’s... It can be expressed simply, but it’s also...yeah, I guess I feel like, at the... as I understood
20055	Well, they don’t have it and they like their life and they don’t know, in some instances they can’t know what they’re missing and, also, people who have that extra sense can’t know what they’re missing by having it. I follow. Like the people in the conversation yesterday on Facebook are sort of making these comments and judgments very much within their own world view without necessarily realizing how much they are in their own world view. There is kind of another side.
20082	that oh, my daughter is on drugs. She would think I have the flu, you know what I mean? Like, she would never think that. I was like I just don't feel well, because I had decided, I think by the time we got there, I was feeling a
20090	her out for dinner a few days later for her birthday and she clearly was like, I don't know if she was offended by that conversation but said, ‘oh, no, no, no, you don't have to do that.' And then he like said he didn't actually take her out for his birthday. They're hard things to have happen at the same time. And then we didn't take her out because he like couldn't even walk to Staples. Not under your control or his.
20108	Yeah, I mean he knows that I'm actually not going to hurt myself, oh, what's the difference, like when he gets really crazy like he's done things like hitting his head on the floor or something. He drags himself from like trying to bash his head in on the wall, but still I'm not like Are you sure that he knows that you're not going to do it? Are you sure you know that you're not going to do it?
20109	Yeah, and then their friends it’s like a backstop, I guess. She isn’t. And you have to be for him and for yourself. Right. I don’t know. I mean, I guess I’m just—I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t really want to—I don’t know. I don’t know, spend too much time, I don’t know, thinking about her or when he, I don’t know, blame her or whatever, family. I don’t know. I need to worry about, I don’t know, other things.
20110	I wake up anxious during the night and sometimes must check things in the house like the windows, doors, coffee pot, and lights in the garage and closets. Then I try to go back to sleep and sometimes I lay awake for hours. So yes, my sleep is interrupted by the checking. Do these actions seem reasonable to you or more than you should be doing? Do you spend more time on these than you would like to? I feel that I must do everything three times.
20149	You don't have total control over what happens. Which is really annoying. I guess maybe I should be getting a spare pair, but I don't actually have my prescription now. Then again, I guess it's been over two years since I've gotten these so I probably am due for . . . and I guess now that my parents aren't paying for all the medical stuff, I don't know that I can afford an optometrist. I don't even know if my health insurance covers it so . . . I know what your benefits are, what made these decisions.
20162	So there's the problem. Yeah. Hurting yourself is hurtful. Yeah. There are really like so many injuries that people get that they like immediately recover from, you know, I feel like the concern with cutting yourself, not that I could do that with the whole and cutting things is that like the concern becomes that you're going to cut yourself too much and too much blood comes out. They're going to get an infection that there will be scars on your body or that you'll like, you know, cut the wrong way and like bleed out. Like,
20165	It is not not why, beating myself up, but just that it is so interesting I find it very interesting that this can happen, that this can even become... So answer your question "Why do I think like this? Why have I become like this?" The answer is... ...Because I have allowed myself to become that way. And perhaps you didn't know you had a choice.
20176	Like it's going on Tuesday. Is he the same person that you had seen when you're just there? Yeah. What did he do? I don't know. Very curt, a little brisk, I guess. It was okay. I had the impression that you're pretty relieved to be feeling a little better. I'm relieved to be. Yeah.
20178	that there is an element in which it’s like, it’s a particular feature of like, we are here having a conversation, and I think about something else for a while. But that’s a... that’s a feature of... of meetings, often. One person is usually talking, usually there is lots of other people who are not talking, so they’re doing something.
20180	The last time we did a little bit of deep breathing and then a very muscle focused one and today just chose something different because I want to give you options and you know try it out. You can try it when you're not panicking, but when you are panicking and know that you're safe. You know if you're sitting in a chair and start to feel a little bit dizzy, it's a different feeling but it's not a dangerous feeling to you. And sometimes people feel dizzy
20187	They're just like help you cut it and then they're just like, "All right, the way in is," you know, whatever. So there's no, "OK, here's what you need to do now" or anything like that, you know. I don't think it's kind of a scatterbrain. You really do the thing where you feel There's not a clinical term for it? There's some clinical terms.
20205	So now I basically have to sit for the next month and see if anybody calls me, so that's going to be hard. That sounds like fun. Oh, yeah. I have pretty much the same conversation with James once a week where I'm so anxious that I'm like, "Well, maybe I should just drop this altogether and look at other fields, like look for a different job altogether." James always says, "Well, if you take a fulltime job, you won't be able to teach next year.
20211	And when I would take it, I felt weird, you know, so I stopped. I was just like, this is crazy, so I turned to coffee. Because there was a story of a model in Florida that died taking a bunch of it. It was also used for weight loss. Right. So I think I might've even been taking it for that as well. It definitely suppresses the appetite. Right.
20286	Is James at home or out somewhere? He’s at home. Yeah. Did you watch anything yesterday? I don’t know. It don’t matter. No. Are you sure of that? Yeah. I of making it through the weekend. Yeah. I know I continue to put the decision about this in your hands, but I assume,
20298	Either you, if you say yes; if you say yes, then either my relationship with you will change in some way internally or I will feel a certain way. Or I won’t. And if I don’t, then that means something about my response to Tanya. It seemed like an important question to at least talk about this part of what we’re doing seemed important. I actually don’t know how much it matters…
20332	That's so much... as a scientist that's... those are... that's a terrible analogy. One, you can predict with far more accuracy than the other by... Mm-hmm. So that's what's wrong with the argument, because you can't know. You can have a fantasy that you can know. I understand your prediction is not 50-50 random guess, but you still can't know. But you certainly feel that your anger can be destructive.
20338	When I'm not really on top of everything? Shouldn't I be, after all...? No, it is... What do you mean "no?" Shouldn't I be an example of a really fine, efficient human being, especially if I I work with young kids and all? Shouldn't I? I can't. I mean, I can, which is funny.
20369	and I guess because I'm thinking if it were just life's stressors that I wouldn't be nearly as upset as I am. Because it feels out of proportion. Yeah, and I shouldn't be feeling like wanting to hurt myself or wanting to kill myself from any of these things. Normal people have job searches and moving and all of those things and don't feel suicidal. They might be sad or overwhelmed, but they're not to the point of wanting to kill themselves because it would make everything easier.
20404	My section stands the whole game. Wow. Because our angle, you know, we're in the corner. We just stand the whole game and tailgate. There are chairs but I stand, and my legs were pretty sore yesterday. Ian progressed a little bit on snowboarding. I think they were going a little higher up, so they were going a little faster. While all the other kids didn't need help, he was holding the instructor's hands down the mountain.
20451	The fact that he kept on telling me that it's okay and nobody minds . . . It's a really uncomfortable feeling to have someone be angry. I felt sort of betrayed by that. I wish he had done more thinking and actually had talked to people to see whether that was a problem, rather than just assuring me that it wasn't a problem when it actually was a problem. And he actually believed it wasn't a problem? Or you think he didn't . . .
20477	might have been a panic attack, but remembering how I felt later, I was really sick from this. So we started driving and I was just like blacking out as we were driving. I felt like I had this fever, like I was just on fire. Yeah, this was not a panic attack, I don't think. Maybe it was part both, you know? You sort of panicked, having that experience.
20480	Clearly you thought about it. I will say with the question about whether I was…I did sort of pause after you asked the question had I been pregnant before. And it wasn’t…
20494	Let's try make it an intention, is my recommendation, to do your best to listen to yourself as well as you might perceive that I listen to you. OK. Make sense?
20543	I'm saying that it can be difficult to diagnose ADD and people can often over-diagnose it. That's largely because there are other conditions that can result in the same symptoms. It's good to work with somebody who is more specialized. The most specialized people are neuropsychologists. The second most specialized people are usually mental health clinicians that work with kids. The third most specialized are pediatricians. Not that they're bad,
20554	I do, we’re going to need to stop James, but I do, I do agree that this sort of, this sensitivity you have, you know, this sort of acute sensitivity, is something to talk about and think about together, that there is a lot there. But, we do need to stop for today. So I'll see you next week. All right, thank you.
20557	If there's ever a time when the thoughts turn into something that do need action and you need someone to help you stay safe, then you can either tell him that, "I need you to do this," or you call me or you call emergency service. There have been a couple of times where I've been like, "Maybe I do need to go to the ER," but I've never gotten to the point where I've actually . . . Where you've really needed that. Yeah.
20563	Yeah, so it's not working perfectly, you know, probably close to perfectly, but it does seem but something has changed and so letting yourself see those little pieces rather than it being all or nothing, rather than it's not working at all. Well? It does seem to be delaying the panic, making yourself recognize different shades of gray. I guess just like my whole understanding of the situation is you know like how
20565	And so when you ask about cognitive behavioral therapy the next step there so one step would be is what you just did for me this is the anxiety lie and here's another way to think about it. Maybe the anxiety feels really horrible right now but it wouldn't be better to die. That's an alternative belief and you just came up with it. The next piece is to look at what you said
20574	So it's nice, because it's like one of my... One of the things that I really hoped that I could do is do chemistry that he would find like in that class of things that really change the way you think about something. And so... you know, I guess I'm proud of having done that. And so that changed my general feelings about getting it done I think. Put me in a place where I feel less like... Put me in a place where I feel more like it would be a very reasonable choice for someone to hire me. So I feel less trapped in that regard also.
20595	I don't know. Maybe. Maybe in degrees he could. I don't know if it would work out. Sometimes when he gets that depressed he keeps on saying that he thinks he can't do X, Y, Z things that I think he can do, but I'm not him. I don't know if it's a cop out or if it's . . . He thinks his depression makes it so he can't physically do whatever thing and I think his depression is telling him he can't do that thing, but he could get around it.
20604	I feel like it’s less important for me to tell you about it when I’m doing better, like when I’m sad or desperate I describe it constantly inside my head. What would I say? which is a little depressing in itself. Are you thinking that it seems a little less self-reflective or more bland or something?
20621	family and it does give you at least a brief moment of respite from your worries and sometimes you know getting a little break from it is what you need. It doesn't necessarily change a whole day of what you're feeling. It gives you a break from it. With a regular practice of meditation you know a lot of people do get a more standing benefit of decreased anxiety, increased acceptance. Is he receptive?
20626	Maybe it's to compete more with Lucille if it's around her. Sure. He's used to me ignoring him. No. It's probably not that. I mean, I don't know how much you ignore him, but it's not something kids get used to. I don't ignore him that much. He asks so many damned questions. He sounds like a very energetic, vigorous, curious, active kid. Yeah.
20633	No, it's not. I just don't want to be this overweight. I guess it's just discouraging that he can do it with seemingly little effort. And that it's taking more effort for you. Yeah. I can understand that it feels frustrating. Considering I'm adding the vegetables to my diet, shouldn't that be helping? I mean I guess it's helping eating healthier, but it might not be helping. Are you replacing something? Are you using the vegetables to replace something else or are they an addition to what you were eating before?
20644	Was that what you were doing when you were overweight as a kid? were you binge eating? But not in front of people. I would do it when I was by myself. Like at night?
20665	James, you know, at the end of the day thanked me for taking care of myself. You know, for actually just saying, "Well, I'm not going to be able to get anything done today. I just need to take a day off." Yeah. But I felt so bad. I hate that. Yeah, I hate myself when I'm like that. I don't know why I can't just get over it or push through it or something. Yeah,
20669	So I can’t ever have a party and I haven’t done things with friends in like forever and it made me really sad. And I feel like I have no friends because Sydney is like, why don’t you just have a couple over. And I’m like if I did, the couple that I’d want to have would be Lucy and Walter, but they’re, you know, they moved to Florida like a year and a half ago now. And you miss them. Yeah. I just don’t feel like I have any close friends anymore and I just couldn’t think of any way.
20706	Sometimes it turns out that I end up going to bed later than I would have liked and I'm still able to get up to work the next morning. Sometimes it ends up with me getting to work later. I've never been at the point where I had gone to work and didn't have anything to eat for lunch. That's good. I don't think I've ever had to miss dinner, either. Is that what you're worried about when you're worrying about not having enough time? Are those the things you're worried about?
20716	This is why I'm having a hard time at this one. Because of your demand that you should be perfect? Yes. So I apologize for not being able to come up with the perfect answer right now. But that is obviously how I torture myself throughout the day.
20720	I can't turn to my husband and say "I'm having a really rough time with your mood swings." I can't do that, I can't say "It really hurts me that you don't support me going to school." I can't do that. I can't... What if in a couple sessions you said "I'm terrified. I am absolutely terrified."
20743	that makes him stressed to be there. We usually end up going to his place because it's easier. I think he'll change when I get to my new place. It feels like those roommates are relaxed. It's nice and it's a lot closer to his place. There are really nice cats there. That will make a difference. That and the whole not having a gluten-free kitchen means not having to worry about going to a restaurant, getting leftovers and not being able to heat them up. I still have to hold out until September. It's the end of June so I still have all of July and August. If I can hold out I'll be fine
20778	but I don’t think he’s very clever. He’s not very clever because he’s not, ok....getting to this you see, he won’t let me talk about this. He sort of listens to it sometime but then sometimes he doesn’t. Right. Can I just clarify why you are here and why I’m here, I’m the psychiatrist... Well I’ve come to see you....in the emergency clinic today.
20817	One of the major symptoms of hyperthyroidism is increased anxiety and one of the major symptoms of hypothyroidism is tiredness and depression. For awhile I don't remember if I told you this, but for awhile she hadn't had the thyroid nodes checked in months and finally did get them checked and she had hyperthyroid numbers, which is the result of essentially taking too much of the thyroid medicine.
20821	I become mad and I feel like I’m less concerned about how other people are going to feel about the things that say than I usually am, which in itself is probably a good thing. But nobody seems to mind. But I can see, in addition to that how, it reflects you’re not doing well, partly because of – it sounds like you’re saying - Yeah. That you feel more abandoned. Yeah. You meant abandon, not abandoned, right?
20861	what the answer to the question is. And I think well it is vaguely related. It is, in a lot of ways, related to my friend Francio, if something is too uncomfortable for him, he will just lie to my face. I’m kind of okay with it, and I’m kind of really not okay with it.
20882	But what does that...I made the horrible mistake the other day saying "I feel like you're two people sometimes, like I feel it's a different personality some times." I made the horrible mistake of that and then days later he said "You called me schizophrenic." I'm like "I never used that word Ivan, like that is so..."  Which is not...schizophrenic is very different than he would be two different people. That's totally different diagnoses. He's not schizophrenic I don't think. So like I really want...
20887	Mm-hmm. And I felt that like rush up my it's like a warm feeling, like my chest gets really hot, almost like there's hot liquid shooting up from here. I thought I was going to vomit at first, but it was yeah. Was having that bad cocaine experience, was that the first time you had a panic attack?
20921	And it's a fine line, it's on a continuum, they're not discrete categories being considerate of others' needs, sometimes means bracketing your needs a bit. Sure. Then, sort of extrapolate out, you know, in and being especially considerate of being desperate. Right.
20946	I made one when I was a kid but I remember nothing about making it other than I won the silliest car, funniest car. I made, like, a Datsun, you know. I don't even remember why it was funny. Ian wants to win the silliest car but we're not making a silly car. I don't know. OK, I think you could do a fine job if you spent, you know, 20 or 30 minutes on Google and YouTube. When am I going to do that? Maybe took a trip to, like...
20948	But if you know that they're thoughts that you're not going to act on, maybe what you want to say to him is, "I'm feeling really sad. Can I have a hug? I'm having a hard time right now. I'd feel better if we could cuddle." Maybe those are the things that you need to share with him. That sounds like it would work. Yeah. I don't know if he'd then be okay with me still crying, but that would at least be better.
20990	So yesterday she sort of said in a slightly peculiar way, goodbye James, which she never really says my name when she’s saying goodbye. I don’t know why, I think. And, you know, so I was concerned for a portion of the day that she was going to kill herself. I think that expresses my feelings about truth and dangerous or something, too.
20993	Something about stopping and holding that felt different.
20998	that was it for video game; like not much fun when you can’t get out of the corner. So that’s what I feel like. Now, my sensation to not being able to get out of the corner in a video game, is that it’s kind of disorienting, among other things. Like you can’t – they move, and you can’t figure out where you’re looking, and - Yeah, and in that game, everything’s dark the entire time. I’m like
21027	but I couldn't stop also not being angry about her misrepresenting our conversations and the conversations she has had with a lot of good people who had advised her in one way or another that there are career things to consider also when one is getting an education.
21067	It was a short time. And the good news I know we have to come to an end now in this session, but the good news was that I did actually speak to him the next day, and he was angry at me because I didn't actually reach out to tell him that I was going to the doctor. And I used your tactic to tell him that I wasn't going right away
21091	I should not make my girlfriend feel like she is responsible for this. Oh, God, this is interesting; yeah, I guess it is. What are the it is the "shoulds" and the "musts?" I must go to work; if I don't, I will be looked I'll look down at myself, I'll let down the kids, I'll disappoint...
21112	And whether that be driving someplace and doing laps in a mall or finding a clear path. You get creative, you can find ways to overcome some of the challenges so that you don’t have to put doing something good for yourself on hold so long. Like laps of running or laps of walking? Walking. Okay, because running in the mall… You can walk laps around any indoor space.
21125	Anyway, when I like involve myself, or fend for myself, there’s at least a presumption that things could be different. But I don’t feel like that’s a possibility.
21130	because like you know when I take the medicine at night that I'm supposed to take at night that's supposed to help with the panic you know, and then an hour later I'm still panicking. Maybe it's not I would have been panicking even more and maybe I'm panicking less but I'm just panicking so much that I can't tell the difference. Sometimes - You know like if my panic level was at 200 and now is at like 250 and so - Right. Maybe you don't notice the difference. Absolutely. Yeah.
21137	Like, yeah, there'll be both of these things. You'll have to deal with some bad things, but there'll be good things. Well, it's not been a whole lot of good things, so... What are you thinking about? I was thinking about the other difficult part of it, which was the family entire. In the entire scope of the weekend I didn't... So Tanya's father and her sister both come to visit us in Andover, but I haven't seen or really spoken with either of them in five or six months. So...
21169	But you don't. But I don't have the ability to because I'm too focused on being right and I don't have the ability to I don't know if I want to be comfortable though at the expense of believing something that isn't true, if I, I don't have that sort of will power to believe something that isn't true. I'm too skeptical. But you're not skeptical of your own beliefs. Well, sometimes I am, but it depends on the situation.
21231	Yea. And I was asking him. But I was like because he knew this girl too. And I was like, "So just to make this clear. You have absolutely you feel absolutely nothing negative when I tell you about her entry." He's like, "Yea, I don't." And I'm like, "Wow." I'm like totally insecure. And you're like and I mean, he's like, "No. I know what I have to get done." And I'm like, "How can you not feel like what you're doing might not be as significant or as popular as what she's doing?
21246	You would think that I was going somewhere but . . . I know this is how Amanda works, so that also makes it hard. She has much more polarity than I do, in some ways. So I feel like sometimes I talk to her from time to time and it will be like she just has this completely different idea of what her life looks like in one conversation than a week later.
21273	It's interested, because I was thinking that when you share something that you really need help with, you're actually assuming that that person would be able to deal with it better than you, right? I'm not saying you feel that way, but that's sort of the reason about talking about this with someone, that it's too much for you. You're hoping they'll actually help you deal with it.
21277	"And I can keep investigating and can stand not having the one perfect solution, which may not even exist." How does that sound? It sounds great. There may be no perfect solution. I will continue to investigate and check out different options in order to feel better, physically. There may not there may not be one perfect answer. "And I can stand it?" And I can stand it. I'm not going to fall apart or
21297	it was okay to do it. That I thought it was okay to be snorting cocaine in the first place, and that I thought it was okay to drive myself and my good friend to go meet my mom and go to a Red Cross information session? Like, I don't even know what...
21310	Yeah. But it's like, I don't know. Like sometimes I have more control than others, but like, you know like I don't control whether or not I have rehearsal. That's like based on the semester and stuff and whether or not we have a concert coming up so you know I had a tech week last week but this week I only had rehearsal on Tuesday night because -
21341	I think really she's actually liked everyone she's seen not in the hospital in Andover very well, so I think maybe there are some leftover biases from poor treatment when she was young. I guess we're going to need to stop in a moment. There is certainly more for us to talk about. I guess, in a sense, what we're talking about, what I'm communicating, is I'm challenging some of the assumptions about how it just logistically made sense that within the logistics there is a lot of meaning behind that,
21368	I can try to respond more calmly but I don't think I'm going to get any less like mad about it. Like I have the right to be mad. He's like, "You can't be mad at me. Don't be mad at me." And I'm like, "You know, I'm allowed my emotions." Yes you are. So all I can really do is just not respond right away and... Why can't you be mad at him? Can he explain why it's not okay for you to be mad? No. He said it's...
21400	put them our forehead across, and say, “Remember that you are dust, and unto dust you shall return.” It’s like one of my favorite services in the year, actually. But, Lent is hard, because it’s sort of traditionally about like repentance, and atonement, and thinking a lot about. I see.
21405	I'm not at all questioning how you feel. You know, do you feel overwhelmed, do you feel anxious and do you feel helpless. I absolutely believe that you do. I know you're not making that up and I know it's really unpleasant. Absolutely. I'm not sure. Is this, like, a bid for attention? Do you want somebody to run in and help you out and fix it and make it better and tell you what to do? Is it because, you know, if you found instructions then you'd actually feel responsible
21410	Yeah. So if you're suffering, it means you're going to be by yourself. Yeah. Which, again, is probably some broader existential question, but I'm not intending . . . No, it's okay. Clearly. I talked to my sister on the phone yesterday and I was doing pretty badly. She was having a good day.
21421	I hear a lot of "suffering will bring you closer to God" and I hear a lot of "suffering will help you be a better person", "understand other people better" or "be closer to other people." I don't feel like either of those are the case. I feel like I just get more and more alone and less and less capable of seeing anything outside of my self. I agree that for you that's often true.
21433	I mean you’re still probably pretty worried about those things. I don’t know. I don’t feel like it. Oh good. Yeah. I don’t – I don’t think that that I’m worried going forward, because I cannot tell James things. Like
21452	Ok looks like 5’5". Go ahead and have a seat. How much? Can I please see what the scale says? I’m fat. Please sit up and I will listen to your heart and lungs. Fine. You know that is not a positive part of your treatment. We have discussed this before. You are here today because your nutritionist and your mom are both very concerned about you. You are very ill, Meg. I am fine. I am eating.
21456	Yeah. I think it’s even more particular than that. That the point of keeping people out, or away from what’s going on, especially like bad things you feel, I think has been because you anticipated that like that would give them a kind of – that would give other people a kind of access to you that would be very dangerous.
21487	In any case now you can continue to make effort and change what has felt so automatic until now because indeed it was modeled, you didn't question it, you took it on and so it became your attitude towards yourself, from what you told me. I didn't know there was anything wrong. But now you do. Now you do. Unhelpful attitude to yourself. Okay. That's true.
21499	So is that voice of, "I should be doing this right or it should be easier" coming up? Mm-hmm. What are you going to tell that? Shut up. All right! Now dispute.
21503	Yeah, part of this thing where I'm sort of like waffle waffle on is sci-fi conventions vary a lot and Aresia is definitely, I don't know how to say it. It's kind of rowdy. It's a little bit rowdy. It's a little bit drunk. It's kind of focused on sex a little bit which comes under the long boring 25 year argument with another sci-fi convention in the area. So there's more
21528	It’s certainly not clear to me whether this is just going to be a life-long illness that will basically have this course. Or whether she will get better. It could really go either way. And A, that you have to think about whether either of those situations are okay, and if you ultimately want this. You know that was strikingly direct. I appreciate it.
21554	and you're not making it up and it's okay to get upset about that or you found a suicide note today, oh my gosh let me listen or let me come over and just hang out with you." I don't know something, but quite frankly I have you and I have my sister and I'm even reluctant...I told her about the note and stuff which I didn't want to do but I really needed to have somebody... Of course you did.
21571	like intrinsic question to me or someone. Sort of like, "Well, it seems like I can't have these things. Is it even okay to want them?" Or something like that. A way in which it's draining is I like to be around people who are excited about something. You know, about particularly about what they're doing, or what they're reading or thinking about, or something. It's just... But... And you've felt like that's not present in Tanya.
21588	" And that's absent so it's all the more infuriating for you. The problem is what if that's what's you're going to get? What if that's who they are? I don't know, I really again I kept trying to emphasize to Dr. Farrow cause I feel like this has been really clear in me for quite a while is I really need something more and it's not...so she's like "Do you need to see
21627	But I'm kind of a little sad about theater department. I went to see my roommate yesterday and she said she keeps they keep finding people. But some for some reason these people don't want my room. So I've already paid for the December rent without actually living there. And I've paid for the January rent also. I feel really bad about this. Just working out $800, $900 a month without like sort of just wasted. So... I mean the reason why I wanted to leave the place I mean, we've talked about all of the
21640	Okay...here it is: "What am I telling myself to make myself depressed?" When you said just now "I'm a fallible human," you jumped already to the E the effective new philosophy. Let's figure out again what you're telling yourself to make yourself depressed, and I'm not overlooking the fact that your physical pain and the steroids and whatever is going on chemically is having some effect. Yes.
21650	From Malasian libraries. I’m just sort of like “Hmmm”. And the post-doc being white wouldn’t necessarily have been a problem on its own, I’ve certainly met her before, but it just all coalesced into me feeling really frustrated and uncomfortable and not being able to leave easily because her talk she was being filmed. So... I see, there would have been film of you getting up and walking out. I see.
21655	Uh huh. And you can see if the warmth is soothing. Or run some really hot water in to water bottle and do the old-fashioned hot water bottle and just give yourself that warmth for a little bit and see if it opens up. Those are little things you can try. Okay. Why don’t we stop there for today? Okay. And I will see you Monday at our regular time. Yeah. Can I borrow a pen so I can write you a check? Sure. Speaking of favorite color, I have green, blue, purple, or red.
21677	I was thinking that. It's not like you guys have to stay here because you both have jobs here and you can't leave. It's true. For a while we were here because Tanya was going to school. And then we were here because Tanya had Chad here and it has been hard for her to find a therapist with whom she can work well, or at least it seemed hard to her.
21687	We need to talk more about it. I wish I’d thought this through more carefully. And the medication obviously may have, but also just, I sort of don’t buy that you get that irritated by being worried about being irritated, compared to how you usually are for something like this, you know? Even if it was so marked, it doesn’t sound like, unless I’m misunderstanding, the kind of difference caused by “I’m just focused on being irritated,
21723	Sorry, I assume that was your lunch. Oh, that’s all right, don’t worry. No, I don’t really“Hey – hey, it’s Tanya. Hey are you there? James? Yeah, okay, sorry. I’m still at therapy. Chad wants me to go to ER, so can you come over? Okay, thanks. Thanks.” Do you know how long he’ll be? Probably ten minutes.
21812	though you don’t necessarily think her kid should be with her ex, that, you know, you don’t feel like you’d be her friend, if you didn’t tell her you thought you could handle her kid, you know, she shouldn’t handle her kid. Whatever; some kind of limit that would also help to protect you. But
21818	I hope you do. Even people with psychoses, who manage them with appropriate medication...can benefit .... Right. ...At the very least, I've seen many work on adopting greater unconditional self acceptance where they remind themselves that they have worth, even with their disability. Wow. So how come they don't have this more in education...? I don't know, but let's get back to looking at you.
21921	A little. I'm not sure if any of the people at the library and the museum know an institution center closer to me that might be looking. I feel like if they did then that would be a good way to go because everybody in the museum thinks that my work is really good. One of the great things about doing this work was to work in the field and make contacts and start developing relationships with people that actually know your work.
21930	like shouldn't a medication change which I guess it has if there's stuff like okay now I'm not panicking every morning, I'm just you know it pushes it off until the afternoon and maybe I should call again and ask her about levels, what if I took half in the morning and half in the afternoon and split it up more?
21960	Especially because you know, it's one thing to talk to the person you know and ask if they can like ask for you. You know, they can vouch for me but like the next person in that line doesn't know me. But they're not vouching for you. Yeah.
21963	So what about choosing the stairs on the way up too? Is that something you feel like you could do? I guess it depends on what I have on. When I had on…the day that I had my backpack and my computer, like I guess I could of. I just was afraid I was going to hurt my back like carrying it up the stairs. I don’t carry that much on me I could. What floor is your apartment?
21995	And "You are here with a neck brace and everybody's going to think that there's something really wrong with you, that you're a mess." Those thoughts won't create depression. What do you add to them? They don't? No, not on their own. Okay I'm frustrated with myself. That doesn't create depression. I want answers to what's going on.
22021	she sent him an e-mail, basically. Very rude.“You owe me this amount or you can sign over the lease to your car.”I’m like,“What the fuck?”I think this is just—not that—I don’t think it’s so much the money’s the issue. It’s just － Asking. the—getting—how he allowed himself to get into this situation. I don’t know. Kicking him while he’s down, I guess. I don’t know. Yeah. I don’t know. So, he told me was going out with some friends Saturday night,
22030	And for most of us our heart rate will go up and down all throughout the day, but most of us don’t worry about it because we don’t notice it, but because you’ve had a panic attack, you’re there thinking ’ooh what’s my heart doing?’, Yeah. And then the minute it starts to change you clock it, you notice it, and then you start to get anxious thoughts, so you might start worrying. I really do start worrying, yes so I keep thinking is it going to be now, you know is my heart going to stop beating.
22059	rely on me when I share these things. Phrasing that seems sort of absurd. But I felt like I talked many times about how strange it is for me to be in a relationship where like I share all of these intimate things and now myself like, you hear, perhaps; occasionally I mentioned in passing the good things in my life. But mostly I talk about the bad things here. So that’s
22069	Jess just needs to get her stupid clients to call the right number, you know. I tell her about it but I'm sure she forgets that she's got it, you know. Hopefully the person that they have an appointment with is good at diagnosing this stuff or is able — Well, there's a six month wait to see this person, so they're clearly a specialist, you know. Right. Alright, whatever.
22141	which is kind of like, it’s really harder to describe. It definitely cemented in my mind that I don’t think I like, at least right now I am not liking that genre of convention, like, which is, I love the costuming that people do, but about half the other things, I was just like no. I just... like having programming running, like, all through the night. So they’re doing gaming and movies. Twenty-four hours.
22155	And then the kid just has a total meltdown, and says you know, goes into a total kid mode of, “You’re not the boss of me; you’re not my mom; you can’t tell me what to do; I want to talk to my mommy.” And then it’s just like a zillion times worse. It’s just like there’s no – I mean I guess there is no reasoning with, you know, a kindergartner no matter what, but
22166	Well, maybe whoever is referring it thinks it might be something else as well. That's a very good point. I'm sure there could be conditions that could look like ADHD that are better ruled out by a developmental pediatrician than by a mental health person that. I'm sure tomorrow, that's when the pediatrician recognizes that Jess is completely overwhelmed and just can't handle, you know. Right. You know, I don't see it.
22169	Trying to focus your mind on things that you can do rather than letting it be filled by whatever pops up which right now when it's empty, the thing that pops up is not feeling good. Question. Should I be like looking into cognitive behavioral therapy group thing? We do lots of cognitive Okay. So would that like be - So the behavioral piece of cognitive behavioral is some of the actions that I encourage you to take,
22216	Yes. So you're doing your job. Yeah. And the temp agency hasn't come through with anything yet? No. I'm going to call... I mean, they sent they said like skipped a week of Christmas and New Year. Right. Mm hmm. So I'm going to call, I don't know, maybe tomorrow or something but they've not come through with anything yet. I will follow up and put it on your list that one of your jobs is to follow up with them tomorrow. Yeah.
22268	He just started yelling at me again. He told me I was selfish and I wasn't thinking about his feelings and he wished that he could believe that I loved him, but he can't because if I did I wouldn't be thinking about suicide and it would destroy his world. What if I attempted suicide and failed Then I would be mentally disabled like his brother and, "Do you really want to be like my brother? Do you really want to have that level of mental reasoning?" You're feeling extremely sympathetic with him, I'm sure, at that point.
22278	should do the same. So, yeah, I always thought that I had it worse than everybody else in the family, but it doesn't seem to be the case. My dad was telling me that he really struggles with it, and my grandmother apparently really struggled with depression. My dad and most of his siblings, he's the youngest of five, and
22283	Yeah. And also, I mean, a lot of what she was talking about, I was like, “That’s what I did as an undergrad in Folklore and Mythology”. Some of these things that she’s talking about. Sorry, did you say you did your undergrad in - No, so some of the things she’s talking about are things that I did as an undergrad in Folklore and Mythology. So like, going out into the community, and collecting stories, and interviewing people... Oh, I see, yes. That makes sense. Yeah.
22402	How is that? It's okay. I got the AC in the room so now it's livable again. It's a little bit annoying in terms of having food that I actually like to eat around and we still haven't made a trip to Hamden; but if we go out to eat for meals and stuff then that's not such a big deal. My room is chaotic, but it's not as chaotic as before, so it's like I can sleep in it without it being an issue.
22434	If you e-mail me the list of people in your insurance who are in the area, I can look through it and see if there is someone I know, unless you think you might know somebody already. It will probably mean a bunch of calls Yep. Okay. All right. We can stop with that for now. It just seems like that's a good ball to get moving. You've probably tried about a million things for sleep, so I'm not going  to try and suggest anything for sleep because you've probably already tried it a few times and it doesn't work
22436	a few more breaths memorizing what it feels like to be as relaxed as you are and when you feel ready let yourself carry that feeling back with you to the room taking it with you. Good job. And I will see you in two weeks or a week and a half, that's a Friday. At 3.30. At 3:30, yeah. We're back to old fashioned
22490	Somebody like a — What is a developmental pediatrician? Well, it's a pediatrician who — well, there are special developmental fellowships, I think, where they — I don't know a lot about it, to tell you the truth, so maybe I — I think they do more training in socio-emotional stuff. See, when I want to cover my ass, I tell people they've got to talk to a lawyer, and you're doing the same thing. You're like "Oh, they need some mental health."
22493	order to maintain it, I have done it more than just in my relationship with Tanya. And it's hard to notice at first, in some sense, because I usually try to be a considerate person, taking into account the needs of other people. So this, in a sense, plays directly into a worldview that I already have and so it's, I think it's hard to notice or has been hard to notice that.
22510	“I just want him to come home.” And I’m like,“Well, that’s not an option. I don’t think that’s good for him” I don’t know. I don’t know what it is. This lack of look into things, do things, I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know, but it’s. Well, maddening in two respects. One, in which . . . . . . it would be good from practical point of view, because she just dealt with this, rather than being so passive. But in other ways, I think it’s . . . imagine her passivity and floppiness and maybe even paralysis really pushes a button for you.
22559	Probably reassuring for you. And I don’t hear in the way you’re putting it, amounts toward her, like it doesn’t sound to me like you are saying this with intents to be critical of her per say. More like, I mean you are critical of how she is with the kid, but you’re protective with the kid. Yeah.
22560	And it seems like, the more I try to recapture a sense of self, the more I am like, what the hell was all of this? And the... You know, I think you've noticed that I value personal responsibility. And we've talked about, to what extent is this Tanya's fault or not Tanya's fault? And so the farther we get from it the... I guess the more a claim of a lack of control or whatever seems like a convenient excuse or something. On her part. Yeah. Yeah.
22564	And could include one around the activating event connected to your girlfriend and your expectations of yourself.
22575	But yeah. I mean I definitely, like, was way more annoyed at people at Arisia than I think I’ve ever been at, say, like, WisCon or one of the other cons I do.
22607	What, in terms of like…I mean there’s…I sort of understand like. I have some awareness of why you’d be thinking about this; about Tanya in particular. But it seems like there’s a lot more to it than just what you said in terms of how you think about having a family or not having a family. So she’s working as a nanny for three small children right now,
22638	Right. You know, one reason, I mean it ends up being sort of circular, but it’s similar to thoughts of like, why aren’t there a lot of women in IT? Well, they get harrassed and it’s really frustrating, or assumed to be inferior and they don’t get hired, so why would you do that? I found her idea that just encouraging them through a sophomore seminar is fixing the problem to be incredibly naive. Ironically
22643	and that was helpful in the short-term. That’s not particularly helpful in like which of those will I end up or should I end up on. And the third is to sort of attempt to estimate the uncertainty we’re bounded in some way. I’m not sure that’s actually feasible here either. So I didn’t hear real well beyond that, just said something about uncertainty. I don’t know what to do about that.
22653	kind of angry abandon that’s got me concerned in a way that I think I was at times last year. My worry about that, is – I mean my concern from like a psychological point of view is that this will convey to you that there’s something about that kind of anger or hostility, being with James that you know, is always going to be too dangerous. So I’m somewhat concerned about that.
22675	What did it do for you?I don't remember in freshman year. I mean, I was a mess freshman year, like it took me a year
22682	we were going to a party, and one of my friends had some. I was really nervous, like I was like is it going to hurt, what's going to happen? It was that girl that I was like, infatuated with, she was doing it, and so I was like okay, I'll try it. And I remember nothing happened, I didn't feel anything, and I was like that's stupid, like I don't feel it. Because I had smoked pot throughout the year and liked it.
22685	One of the reasons that she’s able to…she works as a nanny three days a week, ten hours a day, which is really intense. It’s pretty tiring for her, but being a parent is 164 hours a week. You don’t take time off. That’s not to say that one can’t construct one’s life so that the children go to daycare or have a nanny. The parents don’t share the labor, but it’s always there. You don’t walk away from it. Like she could
22710	Yeah, it's just like, I don't know with Victor. I just feel like there's so much suppressed stuff now. It's just going to be suppressed. I wanted to give him this book for his birthday, but I couldn't even bring myself to mailing it or telling him that I bought it. So Seth keeps telling me, he treated you really, really badly. And he even said yesterday, are you going to ruin your career, your dreams just because of him? You're so, you're obsessed with him. And I was like, God, I hope not, so.
22747	You're burdening her. And in reality she's just like, "It's fine. If I would have tried on that I would have taken a little longer too." Mm hm. It's so striking how quickly it can escalate to, "I hate myself." Which is such a strong thing to say about yourself. It doesn't. I think I have normalized it. Wow. Not to be But it doesn't - No, no, I hear you. I hear you. have a huge impact on me.
22827	but the part about Tanya and this emotional affair being less likely to discuss that with your parents or whomever seems like a different category than Tanya's illness and the extent to which she was suicidal. But somehow you see that as similar maybe? I'm not sure. Yeah, it's not like I haven't told anyone that she's suicidal, but how many details do they need? I feel like the details drive it home more, make it hurt more.
22833	But, again, why would you not be waiting for that right now? And why also, for example, would it not freeze you up from leading a regular, humdrum life?
22872	my antidepressants are working to some degree because may be if I were off of them I don't know if I was off of them if I would completely be sad all the time or if it's just that my depression only shows up some of the time and they're not doing anything. Right. It's not really an experiment to want to do. This is not a controlled study. It would be really a bad idea to just go off of everything. Yes.
22877	which is like you get baptized as an infant and then, at least in Episcopalian and I think in Catholicism and, I'm sure, in some other religions, but you get confirmed as a young adult as like entering into an adult relationship with the church and saying, "I affirm these things and this is who I want to be and this is where I want to be." You usually get confirmed when you're like 13, not when you teach the confirmation class.
22884	You know, that’s why I have to come see doctors, places, hospitals and things like that because they have clever people, you’re a clever person... Right. So do you feel as if you’re more clever than perhaps other people? Well, well, well yeah. You know I’m certainly more clever than those people at work....Ok. ...you know cos they’re a bit thick.
22897	She was the one who told me to do Benadryl. Right, which has the same stuff as She got really aggressive about monitoring my sleep hygiene and telling me I had terrible sleep hygiene; and to do better and these sleep problems would just go away if I followed the rules better. She did nothing? Nope. Have you ever tried I had not. I guess I'm thinking it might be good to get you a new prescriber.
22913	about children and why she's ambivalent and she's pretty sure she doesn't want them. There's one really good part towards the end where she's like, "In the end, I think what it is, is that I don't want to love anything that much," and that's something that I know is in me. I don't want to. I was like, "Wow, that's such a simple way to say it." I know exactly what she's talking about. There is something perversely freeing in not going therecompletely.
22924	How are you? Right now I'm great. Well I'm glad to hear that. It's been a terrible week. Aw. Well, not a terrible week, sleep-wise, but just not a very good week. Josh made me go running this morning with the dog. So I feel pretty good right now. Because he thought you'd feel better?
22929	and then at the very end she asked me, "Are you depressed?" I go, "A little bit." She was like, "Oh, we don't want to go down on the Wellbutrin if you're depressed," so I have to lie to her next time. "No, I'm not depressed. I'm feeling great." You want to go down and I guess your concern is making you more anxious? Could you tell her that, that that's more of an issue than your depression?
23019	little bit it had passed a little bit, so I think I had decided that I was going to try to just like I felt really sick and I wanted to go throw up somewhere. So, we went to the building where the Red Cross thing was being held and it's a federal building, so we had to go through security. I had this gram of cocaine in my purse, that I just stuck on the security belt. Nothing happened, but I
23022	I felt much less like I was floundering. Good. So thanks. I think you asked the question did I feel like I was floundering in my everyday life. I think I sort of said yes yes and no. The answer is probably more yes than no in some ways. But like this is an anchoring point in some sense. So, uh helpful to be here and particularly helpful last week so, thanks.
23039	Really mothering in a very loving way. In a very caring way. Not in a controlling way. Mm hm. Mm hm. But I feel really bad about that. That must be exhausting for her. Well she's doing it in a way that should have happened with your own mother, so that your sister and you could be freed up to have a sister relationship instead of more of a mothering one. So that's what's so complicated.
23057	There is evidence that your positive change is possible. You and I have agreed that you're getting better at catching your should's, your language is changing, you're speaking in language that indicates you're taking responsibility for your emotion rather than blaming the circumstances for example when you say "I 'make myself' hysterical," so there IS progress. Now back to Friday night.
23076	I remember there was one time we decided we'd try it before class, and that was when, after I did that I was like, all right, I think this is going I noticed that my friend Amy, who was like my cocaine buddy, I was like maybe we're on different pages with this, if she's going to be doing this before class, because at that point,
23083	I just think it’s a little depressing that what I feel is so urgent for me to put out in the world is all the worst stuff that happens that is inside of me. The good things seem less important to spread around and – I don’t know – I don’t really think I’m comfortable with that idea. I guess I also feel like everyone would understand what it feels like to be doing pretty well and enjoying my job.
23124	The affair mostly took place during the war. She broke it off with him completely unexpectedly a year and a half ago and he's been basically grieving her ever since. He's kind of a terrible person so he's super jealous of her and hates her and hates her husband. He's hiring a private detective to track her because he thinks she's sleeping with somebody else now. I'd forgotten that it's essentially a book about God.
23156	That’s actually a really I think that analogy I think that at least that analogy conveys to you what you’re feeling. I felt like it was good at doing that at least. I’m glad that it worked. So you know, it’s and part of the thing about feelings is that I don’t think that’s actually what he’s doing and, you know, I actually think he’s very good and I’m glad that we go to him for the most part.
23158	Is there anyone in your daily life that could help hold you accountable to something that you set up? I don't know. Like maybe Sydney could in theory. I don't know if he would. I could ask him. But like something's also are location based. Like I can only do... I can only dye yarn if I'm at my place and not when I'm at his place. But you can be at your place whenever you want. Sort of. I mean, yes and no. Like I can borrow his car and just go there but like if we were like,
23199	I sure sound discouraged, don't I? You do. Yeah, talking about it's making me feel discouraged, or at least it's that's the emotion that's bubbling up. Yeah, I think probably that sounds about right. Just in the sense of like, here we go again. Yeah, I think on any particular day when she's not well I can either handle it just fine
23237	The things that you have control over are exercise, which we know releases endorphins, and thoughts, which might not cause the feelings of depression, but they can exacerbate it or help to alleviate it somewhat. It's not saying that what you're thinking is necessarily the start of the symptoms, but it's something that you do have control over that can push it in one direction or the other.
23254	but I never really like went. I just didn't really try except for my women's studies class, which apparently I cared about and I did well in that class. But then, I don't know what happened. Sophomore year, that changed that because all of a sudden it was all this
23289	I was thinking sometimes it's good to know the road you took to get to a place. And if the goal is to get to a place, maybe it doesn't matter which road you took. It does and it doesn't I guess. Yes. We're going to need to stop for today. Okay? Okay. I will see you next week. Oh, I'm not going to be here next week. Okay. I'm going to be at a work thing combined with a fun thing I'm going to Austin for. I've never been to Austin. Oh, wow.
23307	That’s a really uncomfortable five minutes. It can feel like a really long time when you’re feeling that sad. This morning, I just sort of realized that because it was my birthday and Sydney was…we stayed up late the night before, like we were going to go out and do this and then he like couldn’t go to sleep, and like, you know. He didn’t bother taking an Ambien or you know, Nyquil or whatever
23413	And it's just going to be it's going to waste too much time. So weeks, months I don't really have that shouldn't do that right now at this stage. What do you think the explosives represented? I don't know. Well, now that I'm describing the dream, I'm struck by the whole deceptive aspect of the things. They looked normal. And maybe that's how I feel like stuff comes across as you know,
23450	But how am I supposed to like…usually it happens like at night. Well, it’s not necessarily that it’s just something that helps in the moment, but when you’re more active, that can lower the baseline. The way to discharge some of this energy that’s right now being translated in to anxiety and tension, and all of the good health care, selfcare things that you do, like getting regular sleep, exercising on a regular basis,
23534	- Right, and that could be affecting me. So just to make sure I’ve got the right way around it, it began 6 months ago, pressure at work, Yeah You went to town, you had the first of these attacks, and then since then you’ve had some more of them. Yeah, yeah And now it’s kind of got to the point where you don’t want to go out. I don’t, no... You don’t go to town by yourself. No, I don’t want to risk it to be honest.
23573	That's the silly part of it. It's like they're ridiculously easygoing, for the most part and if they're bothered, they're not going to tell me, so it will be okay And they're coming explicitly to see us and to like help take care of us in this difficult time. So it's So I think that's going to be okay.
23590	I should have called you to let you know, and that not let me just say the thought first and not doing that makes me irresponsible. "As I shouldn't be." As I see, you always add that last part, and that is the... Which I'm encouraging you to do. OK, OK. I meant it before
23628	Please have a seat Meg. Thank you for coming in today. Your nutritionist referred you. It seems that she and your mom have some concerns. Can you sit down and we will take your blood pressure and do some vitals? I guess. I do need to get back to my dorm to study. I have a track meet coming up also that I am training for. I am runner. How many credits are you taking and how are classes going? 21 credits. I am at the top of my class. Could we get this done. I need to get back.
23637	but maybe look into getting like physical therapy..." he would say "I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine!" It was interesting because he was sharing with me that this is what he thought I should do, "You should go call your neurologist, you should..." and I said "There's no point, I don't need to follow up with him and go back in. There's a new doctor I'm seeing on Tuesday"
23641	Yeah. Like last night yesterday I was like able to hold out for, until 4-ish or so and then even then I was still able to like, something like 'cause normally panic attacks like prevent you from going about your day to day life and mine don't. Like I can still do things. Like I still was like, okay well you know I need a lock and someone bought one for me so I am going to walk to the post office and drop off these packages. And you could do it. And I could do it and -
23651	She sent me this really nasty e-mail back saying, "I don't know why this is such a big deal for you, whether you send them to the travel agent or whether dad sends them. Why do you care? Stop bugging dad. Stop using e-mail. You should call and talk to him." I was like, a) I hate using the phone, having  argues on the phone in the best of cases; b) I have a hard time understanding my dad because he mumbles;
23697	I told him I was feeling low and that I was just really upset about a lot of things and I've been having these meltdowns at the end of the day where, almost like a little kid having a meltdown. It's just that they're too tired and they need to go to sleep but they refuse to. It's the same sort of completely losing all grip on reality and feeling like everything is overwhelming and I can't do anything. I know those are really stressful for Dave to witness.
23729	119 before, which is probably ten pounds less than I am right now. So then I probably was like this size when I came home from Madagascar, and I still felt good and I still felt that I looked good. But having being able to eat, I was then more conscious about
23754	I was sort of seeing both sides of it and I guess I was just thinking about how you don’t see what is outside your experience. People say “why do parents choose not to give their children a chance of having a whole other sense?
23762	How did things work out? I've got your message obviously after... Mm hm. No you were very helpful. Thank you for taking time to call me. Sure. So Ivan said he was fine that night, that he didn't need to go anywhere and that...so he didn't do anything further. He did say "I was hoping you wouldn't find that," so we did make the distinction that he was saving it actively. Yeah
23774	I wouldn't say I've thought about a whole lot. But in seeing them again, it's sort of like, yeah, I guess things have been hard here, and where have you all been? And we're not going to even talk about it being... having been hard or anything the entire time that we're here? I just... You know, there's the sort of mutual acknowledgement that it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other, and it's good to see you. And I think that was real. That's about it, so...
23831	But with restorative yoga discipline you lie in the dark. Maybe we'll try that. Or even any really gentle practice he could probably do. Just a more Hatha based on rather than Vinyasa style. Yeah, he gets upset going to regular yoga classes. He feels like it's a competition that he can't do anything and everyone else around him is doing it. He gets kind of worked up about it. I actually had a yoga teacher who used to say, ‘this is not a competition. Yoga is not a competitive sport.'
23844	You know, I made the vows fully aware of Tanya's history of depression and amidst the anxiety that was her sort of default state during the wedding planning. But this... where we are now is not really on the map when I did that, so, you know. The whole thing kind of has a, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, sort of duality contrast thing to it. So it's hard to deal with when it feels vaguely like a bait and switch.
23879	Mostly just me in the uncomfortable feeling, my brain telling me that if I physically hurt myself it would feel better. Do you have a particular way of thinking about hurting yourself? Just a general "hurt myself," not do something specific? Sometimes it might be flashes of cutting myself, but in reality I have a weird squeakiness about cutting skin, so I wouldn't do that. I think it's more of a "you need to hurt yourself in order to feel better." Have you ever done that?
23893	"I'm educated," I said "How do you know all this about herniated discs?" and he said "Well I'm educated," and I'm like "Oh so I'm not?" like I don't know anything. So it was funny because thinking back when you made a couple comments about like is he the only, the doctor he was going to recommend, like is he the only doctor who can possibly help me? It
23938	noticing how that brings more tension to your face and then when you're ready to exhale you're going to let that go, letting your eyes remain gently closed. And repeating that, as you inhale squeezing your eyes tightly shut and then when you're ready to exhale, letting that go, letting your eyes stay gently closed and noticing how it feels to be relaxed.
23939	Maybe. It’s just that I’m sort of…I feel a little bit uncomfortable with that because then it’s like, you know, suggesting an activity that people have to spend money on. I mean, which I guess is okay, and also like pending whether or they eat kosher, and that’s going to be an issue. I guess most of my friends don’t…possibly all of my friends, they can of at least like dairy food out in a restaurant, or non-kosher restaurant.
23948	Not days like in the last several months, but that's because there has been a sense in which the Tanya I would have those conversations with, hasn't existed in the last several months. There is a sense in which she really is there again. So, yeah, those are conversations that would be good to have as conversations and not just me telling her that she needs to take this medication.
23970	Which is - 40 days. It’s not really one I can talk about with people. People are like, “What are you giving up for Lent?” Like that’s something people actually ask, which I don’t know, I feel like I’m only now realizing like how glaringly inappropriate that question is. Like if they’re asking intrusive questions, then that would be a lie. Then you make your point.
23977	No. I can’t get to the appointments all the time. I told him that it was tough for me to get there all the time and he was no help. Asshole. I hate him. He was going to help me too. I need to get back to my room. I love to watch my TV you know. I have my favorites that I never like to miss. You find some joy in your life then with the favorite TV programs? Never said I didn’t. I enjoy things, of course! I’m not crazy.
23991	I put my shoulders back. That allows you to open up your chest a little bit. That can help. A lot of times, slowing down your breath can work to relax you a little bit; let your muscles relax. If you can’t get it to go away, remember that it’s going to go away eventually. It has never lasted forever. True. It’s always gone away eventually. And sometimes just knowing that it’s going to end and it’s uncomfortable. As it is, it’s not harmful to you. You’re safe. That can…
24009	Geneva, I was like maybe I'll give it one more shot, because I really missed the feeling that it gave me. What feeling was that? Just like, I felt like it's the same feeling that I get now when I'm in the middle of a really good run or in the middle of a really good workout, and I have great music on and I have high energy and I can feel my muscles getting stronger, you know?
27243	in a good way! Yeah. Okay.
27245	make tight fists noticing where that brings tension to your forearms, wrists and fingers, exhale, release, let the tension drain out of your fingertips. Inhale squeezing those tight fists, exhale release let it all go. Inhale and focus on tightening your abdominal wall, squeezing your belly button toward your spine and as you exhale let your stomach relax a full deep breath letting your belly be soft. On your next inhale you're going to squeeze your belly button towards your spine tightening your stomach again and then as you exhale let your belly be soft taking a full deep breath.
