Eventually, he will and then he won't be like this anymore. I mean, some things might still be the same but like he won't... You know, the low libido won't be an issue anymore and, I mean, I guess he'll still be an insomniac but if I can separate my plans from his... I think me having a job would also help things a lot because then I would be getting out of the house and stuff.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]	[]	[]	[]	[]

Yeah. And more so because, you both know it. Yeah. Like she’s not containing the kid at all. No. And like it’s super frustrating when we hang out,	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]	[]	[]	[]	[]
43530	It’s not a difference both groups seem to want. I don’t know. If we did move, this would be the first time that I moved to a new city where I didn’t know anybody or didn’t know more than a couple of people and wasn’t already in some sort of graduate program or a workplace or something to anchor me. It doesn’t make me anxious, but I feel like maybe it ought to. I think that that could go really badly,	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]	[]	[]	[]	[]
43536	Or I wish I - Like at a job interview, you mean? Yeah. That could be. Hm. Or as simple as, "I wish I hadn't kept my sister waiting." Or, "I wish I was more decisive about that." And it's "I hate myself." And then it can stay low for a little while. Ah.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]	[]	[]	[]	[]
43609	Yeah. You know, things like taking care of him and making food and doing all these things that like, you know, when I was sick and he was panicking, I would still do things for him. You know? I would still make him food even when I was sick or like do crazy things like emptying the dishwasher at his place, standing on a chair while dizzy which I really should not have been doing and things like that.

43634	Yeah, I'm not sure where to begin so I it's a strange thing come and not know what I'm asking to consult with you on. But that's where I am. Well, I don't think of it as session to session but I think of it as what you've framed what you're asking for consultation on. This is part of the process. Okay, well thanks. That's helpful.

43669	And was the hope that had I had a miscarriage or had an abortion or something like this – I guess those were the two conditions under which I would be pregnant and not have a child right, I guess those were the only two – that I would say more about that or just that it would be acknowledged or what would happen? That’s a good question.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]	[]	[]	[]	[]

They sell a lot of things that are gluten-free in grocery stores; or rather there is this one symbol that appears on a lot of cheeses that my house doesn't accept.

43699	Well, it sounds like you have extreme reactions sorry, There's no need to apologize for your feelings. You have strong feelings so you get really pumped when there's something to get up for and you get a good reaction and it sounds like you had a good talk and you get really sad when there's something sad. That's just part of who you are and it's okay. It makes me feel crazy. It doesn't seem crazy from where I sit. I wonder why it feels not okay for you to have those highs and lows.
