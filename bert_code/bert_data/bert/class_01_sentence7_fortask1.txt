18301	wait until you have run out and get it a few days later, but There are a couple of questions that I have. One is what are you worried about in sort of saying in the moment when you're feeling upset about something like this?

18330	It seems very honest. Yeah.

Well, it's four days a week, but hours wise it's about maybe 12 hours a week. I just feel like that should make our life easier because Harold has time to do a lot of things that I'm still doing. I'm still cooking. I'm still doing the food shopping. A lot of times when I bring it up, he says, you know, why don't you ask me? I say why should I have to ask you?

18397	Yeah, I don't have a particularly clear view of what a tenable strategy is at this point. Well, when one feels really, really angry at the person or people they love, being worried about the impact of that anger, I think, is a general fear.

So just to make sure I’ve got the right way around it, it began 6 months ago, pressure at work, Yeah You went to town, you had the first of these attacks, and then since then you’ve had some more of them. Yeah, yeah And now it’s kind of got to the point where you don’t want to go out. I don’t, no... You don’t go to town by yourself. No, I don’t want to risk it to be honest.

23628	Please have a seat Meg. Thank you for coming in today. Your nutritionist referred you. It seems that she and your mom have some concerns. Can you sit down and we will take your blood pressure and do some vitals? I guess. I do need to get back to my dorm to study. I have a track meet coming up also that I am training for. I am runner. How many credits are you taking and how are classes going? 21 credits. I am at the top of my class. Could we get this done. I need to get back.

It was interesting because he was sharing with me that this is what he thought I should do, "You should go call your neurologist, you should..." and I said "There's no point, I don't need to follow up with him and go back in.

23641	Yeah. Like last night yesterday I was like able to hold out for, until 4-ish or so and then even then I was still able to like, something like 'cause normally panic attacks like prevent you from going about your day to day life and mine don't. Like I can still do things. Like I still was like, okay well you know I need a lock and someone bought one for me so I am going to walk to the post office and drop off these packages.

So then I probably was like this size when I came home from Madagascar, and I still felt good and I still felt that I looked good.

23762	How did things work out? I've got your message obviously after... Mm hm. No you were very helpful. Thank you for taking time to call me. Sure. So Ivan said he was fine that night, that he didn't need to go anywhere and that...so he didn't do anything further. He did say "I was hoping you wouldn't find that," so we did make the distinction that he was saving it actively. Yeah	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]	['FAMILYNAME', 'DATE']	['Ivan', 'night']	[]	[]
23844	You know, I made the vows fully aware of Tanya's history of depression and amidst the anxiety that was her sort of default state during the wedding planning. But this... where we are now is not really on the map when I did that, so, you know. The whole thing kind of has a, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, sort of duality contrast thing to it.

There is a sense in which she really is there again. So, yeah, those are conversations that would be good to have as conversations and not just me telling her that she needs to take this medication.

People are like, “What are you giving up for Lent?” Like that’s something people actually ask, which I don’t know, I feel like I’m only now realizing like how glaringly inappropriate that question is.

24009	Geneva, I was like maybe I'll give it one more shot, because I really missed the feeling that it gave me. What feeling was that?
